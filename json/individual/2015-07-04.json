  "description": "In late 1968 Elvis Presley’s career was in decline after years of corny movies and a departure from his rock and roll roots.  But a brilliantly-conceived TV special hit the airwaves and put the iconic singer back on the map.  Experience the music from that special event on this week's edition of Cyprus Avenue.",
