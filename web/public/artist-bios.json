  "Al Green": {
    "bio": "Reverend Albert Green (born April 13 1946 in Forrest City, Arkansas) is an American Grammy award winning soul and gospel singer who enjoyed great popularity in the 70s with hit singles such as \"Let's Stay Together\", Tired of Being Alone\", and \"You Oughta Be With Me\". Green has boasted a voice capable of both fluid high streams of sugar and deep south growls and rasps. He has sold over 20 million records worldwide, and he was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, being referred to as \"one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music.\"\n\nGreen was born in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He started performing at age ten in a Forrest City quartet called the Greene Brothers; he dropped the final \"E\" from his last name years later as a solo artist. They toured extensively in the mid-1950s in the South until the Greenes moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when they began to tour around Michigan. His father kicked him out of the group because he caught Green listening to Jackie Wilson.\n\nIn 1967 at the age of 16, Al formed an R&B group, Al Green & the Creations, with several of his high-school friends. Two Creation members, Curtis Rogers and Palmer James, founded their own independent record company, Hot Line Music Journal, and had the group record for the label. By that time, the Creations had been re-named the Soul Mates. The group's first single, \"Back Up Train,\" became a surprise hit, climbing to number five on the R&B charts early in 1968. The Soul Mates attempted to record another hit, but all of their subsequent singles failed to find an audience. In 1969, Al Green met bandleader and Hi Records vice president Willie Mitchell while on tour in Midland, Texas. Impressed with Green's voice, he signed the singer to Hi Records, and began collaborating with Al on his debut album\n\nHe was perhaps the ideal complement to the orchestral, syrupy, strong soul production work of Hi Records wizard Willie Mitchell, who also helmed 70s classics for Syl Johnson, Ann Peebles, and himself.\n\nOn October 18, 1974, Mary Woodson, a woman who was his longtime girlfriend, threw a large pot of sticky boiling grits on him as he was preparing to shower, because he didn't want to get married. She committed suicide in minutes, which deeply affected Green to turn to God and religion. This assault from behind caused third-degree burns on his back, stomach and arm. Deeply shaken, Green continued to reaffirm and grow closer to his deeply held love for God, and became an ordained pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Memphis in 1976. \nContinuing to record R&B, Green saw his sales start to slip and drew mixed reviews from critics. 1977's The Belle Album was critically acclaimed but did not regain his former mass audience. In 1979 Green injured himself falling off the stage while performing in Cincinnati and interpreted this as a message from God. He then concentrated his energies towards pastoring his church and gospel singing, also appearing in 1982 with Patti Labelle in the Broadway musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God. According to Glide Magazine, \"by the late 70s, he had begun concentrating almost exclusively on gospel music.\" His first gospel album was The Lord Will Make a Way. From 1981 to 1989 Green recorded a series of gospel recordings, garnering eight \"soul gospel performance\" Grammys in that period. In 1985, he reunited with Willie Mitchell along with Angelo Earl for He Is the Light, his first album for A&M Records. In 1984, director Robert Mugge released a documentary film, Gospel According to Al Green, including interviews about his life and footage from his church. In 1989, Green released \"I Get Joy\", again with producer/guitarist Angelo Earl. In 2001, he appeared in the movie and soundtrack of On the Line featuring Lance Bass.\n\nAfter spending several years exclusively performing gospel, Green began to return to Rhythm & Blues. First, he released a duet with Annie Lennox, \"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\" for Scrooged, a 1988 Bill Murray film. In 1989 Green worked with producer Arthur Baker writing and producing the international hit \"The Message Is Love\". In 1991 he created the introductory theme song for the short-lived television series Good Sports featuring Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett. In 1992, Green recorded again with Baker, the Fine Young Cannibals, and reunited with his former Memphis mix engineer (this time functioning as producer) Terry Manning, to release the album Don't Look Back. His 1994 duet with country music singer Lyle Lovett blended country with R&B, garnering him his ninth Grammy, this time in a pop music category. Green's first secular album in some time was Your Heart's In Good Hands (1995), released to positive reviews but disappointing sales, the same year Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nIn 2000, Green published Take Me to the River, a book discussing his career. Green received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.\nIn 2001, Green's live cover of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was released on the soundtrack to Will Smith's film Ali (the song plays when Muhammad Ali learns of the death of close friend Malcolm X).\nBy 2003 Green released a non-religious (secular) album entitled I Can't Stop, his first collaboration with Willie Mitchell since 1985's He is the Light. In March 2005 he issued Everything's OK as the follow-up to I Can't Stop. Green also collaborated with Mitchell on this secular CD.\n\nThe title of Al Green's latest album Lay It Down released May, 2008, truly tells it like it is. Conceived as a collaboration between the soul legend and a handful of gifted young admirers from the worlds of contemporary R&B and hip hop, the album is drawn from a series of inspired sessions that yielded the most high-spirited, funky and often lushly romantic songs of Green's latter-day career.\n\nThe project features the sophisticated R&B voices of singer-songwriters John Legend, Anthony Hamilton and Corinne Bailey Rae, and it was co-produced with Green by two of hip-hop's most innovative players, drummer Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson from the Roots and keyboardist  James Poyser , the go-to guy for high-profile artists ranging from Erykah Badu to Common. Add in Brooklyn's celebrated  Dap-King Horns (Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse), guitarist Chalmers \"Spanky\" Alford (Mighty Clouds of Joy, Joss Stone) and bassist Adam Blackstone (Jill Scott, DJ Jazzy Jeff), among others, and you've got a modern soul-music dream team, fronted by the most expressive voice in the business.

  "Alejandro Escovedo": {
    "bio": "Alejandro Escovedo (born January 10, 1951, in San Antonio, Texas) is a Mexican-American singer-songwriter.\n\nEscovedo's family tree includes former Santana percussionist Pete Escovedo and Pete's daughter, Sheila E (also Prince's former drummer and later a pop star). He began his music career with the Nuns, a mid-'70s punk band based in San Francisco. He co-founded the pioneering cowpunk band Rank and File in 1979, which moved to Austin, Texas, in 1981 after a stint in New York City. The band released Sundown on Slash Records in 1982, but shortly after, Escovedo left to form the True Believers with brother Javier. The band recorded two albums for EMI and toured the country, often as an opening act for Los Lobos. However, EMI opted not to release the second album, which eventually led to the group's break-up. (It eventually surfaced as a bonus item when Rykodisc reissued the first set on CD in 1994.) \n\nEscovedo released a solo album in 1992 on Watermelon Records, Gravity, uniting his wide variety of styles; the album was produced by Stephen Bruton of Bonnie Raitt's band. Escovedo also began gigging periodically with the band Buick MacKane, who fused old-school punk with 70's glam rock; after Rykodisc released Escovedo's With These Hands in 1996, they followed it up with Buick MacKane's long-awaited album. After Escovedo parted ways with Rykodisc, he signed with the Chicago-based alt-country label Bloodshot in 1998, who released the live album More Miles Than Money: Live 1994-1996 and the acclaimed studio set A Man Under The Influence. \n\nIn April of 2003, Escovedo collapsed following a show in Phoenix, AZ, and he was subsequently diagnosed with Hepatitis C. An outpouring of support from musicians led to a series of successful benefit concerts to help pay Escovedo's medical expenses and keep his music before the public, followed by a tribute album, Por Vida: A Tribute to the Songs of Alejandro Escovedo, which was released in 2004. \n\nIn June 2010, Escovedo released Street Songs of Love.

  "Alicia Keys": {
    "bio": "Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), better known by her stage name Alicia Keys, is an American recording artist, musician and actress. She was raised by a single mother in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan in New York City, New York, United States. At age seven, Keys began to play classical music on the piano. She attended Professional Performing Arts School and graduated at 16 as valedictorian. She later attended Columbia University before dropping out to pursue her music career. Keys released her debut album with J Records, having had previous record deals first with Columbia and then Arista Records.\nThroughout her career, Keys has won numerous awards including 14 Grammy awards and has sold over 75 million records worldwide. Billboard magazine named her the top R&B artist of the 2000–2009 decade, establishing herself as one of the best-selling artists of her time. In 2010, VH1 included Keys on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nKeys released her first studio album, Songs in A Minor, in June 2001. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 236,000 copies in its first week. The album sold over 6.2 million copies in the United States, where it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It went on to sell over 13 million copies worldwide, establishing Keys' popularity both inside and outside the United States, where she became the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001. The album's lead single, Fallin', spent six weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's second single, A Woman's Worth, peaked at number three on the same chart. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.\n\nSongs in A Minor led Keys to win five awards at the 2002 Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for Fallin', Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album; Fallin' was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Grammy Awards. That same year, she collaborated with Christina Aguilera for the latter's upcoming album Stripped on a song entitled Impossible, which Keys wrote, co-produced, and provided with background vocals. During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.\n\nKeys followed up her debut with The Diary of Alicia Keys, which was released in December 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 618,000 copies its first week of release, becoming the largest first-week sales for a female artist in 2003. It sold 4.4 million copies in the United States and was certified four times Platinum by the RIAA. It sold nine million copies worldwide, becoming the sixth biggest-selling album by a female artist and the second biggest-selling album by a female R&B artist. The singles You Don't Know My Name and If I Ain't Got You both reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the third single, Diary, entered the top ten. The fourth single, Karma, was less successful on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 20. If I Ain't Got You became the first single by a female artist to remain on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for over a year.\n\nKeys won Best R&B Video for If I Ain't Got You at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards; she performed the song and Higher Ground with Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder. Later that year, Keys released her novel Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics, a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The title derived from one of her poems, \"Love and Chains\" from the line: \"I don't mind drinking my tears for water.\" She said the title is the foundation of her writing because \"everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question\". The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made The New York Times bestseller list in 2005. The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video Karma. Keys performed If I Ain't Got You and then joined Jamie Foxx and Quincy Jones in a rendition of Georgia on My Mind, the Hoagy Carmichael song made famous by Ray Charles in 1960 at the 2005 Grammy Awards. That evening, she won four Grammy Awards: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for If I Ain't Got You, Best R&B Song for You Don't Know My Name, Best R&B Album for The Diary of Alicia Keys, and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\" for My Boo with Usher.\n\nKeys performed and taped her installment of the MTV Unplugged series in July 2005 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. During this session, Keys added new arrangements to her original songs and performed a few choice covers. The session was released on CD and DVD in October 2005. Simply titled Unplugged, the album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with 196,000 units sold in its first week of release. The album sold one million copies in the United States, where it was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and two million copies worldwide. The debut of Keys' Unplugged was the highest for an MTV Unplugged album since Nirvana's 1994 MTV Unplugged in New York and the first Unplugged by a female artist to debut at number one. The album's first single, Unbreakable, peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot Adult R&B Airplay for 11 weeks.\n\nKeys opened a recording studio in Long Island, New York, called The Oven Studios, which she co-owns with her production and songwriting partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers. The studio was designed by renowned studio architect John Storyk of WSDG, designer of Jimi Hendrix' Electric Lady Studios. Keys and Brothers are the co-founders of KrucialKeys Enterprises, a production and songwriting team who assisted Keys in creating her albums as well as create music for other artists.\n\nIn 2006, Keys won three NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for Unbreakable. She also received the Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2006, she played the voice of Mommy Martian in the \"Mission to Mars\" episode of the children's television series The Backyardigans, in which she sang an original song, Almost Everything Is Boinga Here. That same year, Keys nearly suffered a mental breakdown. Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to \"escape\" and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: \"That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible.\"\n\nKeys released her third studio album, As I Am, in November 2007; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 742,000 copies in its first week. It gained Keys her largest first week sales of her career and became her fourth consecutive number one album, tying her with Britney Spears for the most consecutive number-one debuts on the Billboard 200 by a female artist. The week became the second largest sales week of 2007 and the largest sales week for a female solo artist since singer Norah Jones' album Feels like Home in 2004. The album has sold nearly four million copies in the United States and has been certified three times Platinum by the RIAA. It has sold nearly six million copies worldwide. Keys received five nominations for As I Am at the 2008 American Music Award and ultimately won two. The album's lead single, No One, peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, becoming Keys' third and fifth number-one single on each chart, respectively. The album's second single, Like You'll Never See Me Again, was released in late 2007 and peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The album's third single, Teenage Love Affair, peaked at number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. She released the fourth single, Superwoman, which peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 12 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\nNo One earned Keys the awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Keys opened the ceremony singing Frank Sinatra's 1950s song Learnin' the Blues as a \"duet\" with archival footage of Sinatra in video and No One with John Mayer later in the show. Keys also won Best Female R&B Artist during the show.  Keys, along with The White Stripes' guitarist and lead vocalist Jack White, recorded the theme song to Quantum of Solace, the first duet in Bond soundtrack history. In 2008, Keys was ranked in at number 80 the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. She also received three nominations at the 2009 Grammy Awards and won Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for Superwoman.\n\nIn an interview with Blender magazine, Keys allegedly said \"'Gangsta rap' was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other, 'gangsta rap' didn't exist\" and went on to say that it was created by \"the government\". The magazine also claimed she said that Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were \"essentially assassinated, their beefs stoked by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing\". Keys later wrote a statement clarifying the issues and saying her words were misinterpreted. Later that year, Keys was criticized by anti-smoking campaigners after billboard posters for her forthcoming concerts in Indonesia featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand sponsored by tobacco firm Philip Morris. She apologized after discovering that the concert was sponsored by the firm and asked for \"corrective actions\". In response, the company withdrew its sponsorship.\n\nKeys collaborated with record producer Swizz Beatz to write and produce Million Dollar Bill for Whitney Houston's seventh studio album, I Look to You. Keys had approached Clive Davis for permission to submit a song for the album. Keys also collaborated with recording artist Jay-Z on the song Empire State of Mind from his 2009 album, The Blueprint 3. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 and became her fourth number-one single on that chart.\n\nThe following month, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers honored Keys with the Golden Note Award, an award given to artists \"who have achieved extraordinary career milestones\". She collaborated with Spanish recording artist Alejandro Sanz for Looking for Paradise, which topped the Hot Latin Songs chart. Keys released her fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom, in December 2009. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 417,000 copies in its first week. As part of the promotional drive for the album, she performed at the Cayman Island Jazz Festival on December 5, the final night of the three day festival which will be broadcast on Black Entertainment Television (BET). The album's lead single, Doesn't Mean Anything, has peaked at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100. Keys was ranked as the top R&B recording artist of the 2000–2009 decade by Billboard magazine and ranked at number five as artist of the decade, while her song, No One, was ranked at number six on the magazine's songs of the decade. In the United Kingdom, The Element of Freedom became Keys' first album to top the UK Albums Chart.\n\nAccording to Songfacts, Keys said regarding the title of her fifth studio album, Girl On Fire. \"Before making this record, in some ways I felt like a lion locked in a cage. I felt like a girl misunderstood that no one really knew, I felt like it was time to stop making excuses for any part of my life that I wanted to change. Once I made that choice I became a Girl on Fire, the lion broke free!!\" The title track will be made available on iTunes and radio on September 4, 2012.\n\nIn May 2009, Swizz Beatz announced that he and Keys were romantically involved, and in May 2010, a representative for Keys and Swizz Beatz confirmed that they were engaged and expecting a child together. During the time of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the couple took part of a union and had the unborn child blessed in a Zulu ceremony, which took place in the Illovo suburb of South Africa. Keys and Swizz Beatz were married on the French island of Corsica on July 31, 2010. On October 14, 2010, Keys gave birth to a son, Egypt Daoud Ibarr Dean, in New York City.\n1997\n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Allen Toussaint": {
    "bio": "Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 – November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter/composer, record producer, and influential figure in New Orleans R&B.\nMany of Toussaint's songs became familiar through versions by other musicians, including \"Working in the Coal Mine\", \"Ride Your Pony\", \"Fortune Teller\", \"Play Something Sweet (Brickyard Blues)\", \"Southern Nights\", \"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\", \"I'll Take a Melody\", \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\" and \"Mother-in-Law\".\n\nToussaint (/ˈtuːsɑːnt/) grew up in a shotgun house in the New Orleans neighborhood of Gert Town, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. After a lucky break at age 17 in which he stood in for Huey Smith at a performance with Earl King's band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians who performed regularly at a night club on LaSalle street Uptown; they were known as the Dew Drop Set.  He initially recorded for RCA Victor as Al Tousan and recorded an album of instrumentals, including the song \"Java\", which became a #1 hit for Al Hirt (also on RCA) in 1964.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Toussaint  was a prolific writer, producer and arranger, creating numerous hits for a variety of artists including Lee Dorsey, Robert Palmer, The Showmen, The Meters, Betty Wright, Solomon Burke and Willie West. He produced material for Dr John, Labelle, Chocolate Milk and Aaron Neville amongst many more. \n\nAn accomplished pianist and lyricist, Toussaint wrote many hit songs including early instrumental efforts Java (a hit for Al Hirt) and Whipped Cream  which went platinum when done by Herb Alpert. Other Toussaint compositions that continue to be covered by artists to this day, include \"Working in a Coalmine\", \"PLAY SOMETHING SWEET (BRICKYARD BLUES)\", \"Get Out My Life Woman\" and \"Yes We Can Can\". Some of his songs from the 1950s and 1960s were penned under his mother's maiden name, the pseudonym Naomi Neville. These include  Fortune Teller recorded by the Rolling Stones, and \"Ruler of My Heart\", recorded by Irma Thomas and reinterpreted as \"Pain in My Heart\" by Otis Redding. He arranged horn parts for The Band, and wrote what became one of Glen Campbell's biggest hits Southern Nights as well as A Certain Girl , which charted when recorded by acts as diverse as Warren Zevon, Benny Spellman and The Yardbirds.\n\nAside from his success behind the scenes, Toussaint also launched his own solo career, which peaked in the '70s with the albums \"From a Whisper to a Scream\" and \"Southern Nights\". For much of his career he partnered with Marshall Sehorn. They co-owned and operated the Sea-Saint recording studio in the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans. They also partnered in a record label, that went under various names. Along with many of his contemporaries, Allen Toussaint found that interest in his compositions was rekindled when his work began to be heavily sampled by hip hop artists in the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nDespite rumours at the time, Toussaint did not take refuge at the Louisiana Superdome in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Instead, Toussaint weathered out the storm in the Astor Crowne Plaza Hotel. After the hurricane Toussaint left New Orleans for New York City, where he was living while his house was rebuilt. His first television appearance after the hurricane was on the September 7, 2005 episode of The Late Show with David Letterman, sitting in with Paul Shaffer and his CBS Orchestra. Toussaint performed each month at Joe's Pub in New York City.\n\n\"The River In Reverse\", Toussaint's collaborative album with Elvis Costello, was released on 29 May 2006  and was recorded in Toussaint's native New Orleans and Hollywood with help from engineer and producer Joe Hardy. Costello and Toussaint assembled a big band and embarked on a tour of theaters and festivals and released a DVD of their collaboration. \n\nToussaint died in the early hours of November 10, 2015 while on tour in Madrid, Spain. Following a concert at the Teatro Lara, he suffered two cardiac arrests at his hotel and was pronounced dead on his arrival at hospital. He was 77. He is survived by his two children, including son Clarence (better known as Reginald) and daughter Alison, and by several grandchildren. His children had managed his career in recent years.\n\n\nA significant early influence on Toussaint was the second-line piano style of Professor Longhair. In his early years he worked mainly for Joe Banashak's Minit Records and Instant Records, but after Minit was sold to its distributor, he teamed up with Marshall Sehorn, starting their own record label variously known as Tou-Sea, Sansu, Deesu or Kansu. In 1973 Toussaint and Sehorn created the Sea-Saint recording studio in Gentilly.\n\nIn the early 1960s he wrote and produced a string of hits for New Orleans R&B artists such as Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas, Art and Aaron Neville, The Showmen, and Lee Dorsey.\n\n\"Ruler of My Heart\", recorded by Irma Thomas. This song was subsequently recorded by Otis Redding under the title \"Pain in My Heart\", and by The Rolling Stones on their second album.\nIn 1964, \"A Certain Girl\" (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by The Yardbirds; the song was released again in 1980 by Warren Zevon.\nA two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised \"Lipstick Traces (On A Cigarette),\" later covered by The O'Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton.\nThe simple but effective \"Fortune Teller\", which was covered by many 1960s rock groups including The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, The Who, The Hollies, The Throb, and ex-Searchers founder member Tony Jackson.\nToussaint credited about twenty songs to his parents, Clarence and Naomi. These include Benny Spellman's 1961 original version of \"Fortune Teller\" and The Artwoods' 1966 version of \"Work, Work, Work\". Alison Krauss and Robert Plant 2007 covered \"Fortune Teller\" on their 2007 collaboration album Raising Sand. A fairly thorough song list appears in Toussaint's discography section Pseudonyms, below.\n\nToussaint's piano and arrangements show up on hundreds of records during the early 1960s on records by Lee Dorsey, Chris Kenner, and scores of other artists. Starting in the 1970s, he switched gears to a funkier sound, writing and producing for The Meters, Dr John, and the Wild Tchoupitoulas Mardi Gras Indians tribe. He also began to work with non-New Orleans artists such as B.J. Thomas, Robert Palmer, Willy DeVille, Sandy Denny, Elkie Brooks, Solomon Burke, Scottish soul singer Frankie Miller (High Life) and southern rocker Mylon LeFevre.[citation needed] He arranged horn music for The Band's 1971 album Cahoots, plus Rock of Ages and The Last Waltz film, in conjunction with arranging horn parts for their concert repertoire. Boz Scaggs recorded Toussaint's \"What Do You Want the Girl to Do?\" on his 1976 album Silk Degrees, which reached #2 on the U.S. pop albums chart. In 1976 he also collaborated with John Mayall on the album Notice to Appear.\n\nToussaint also launched his own solo career, which peaked in the 1970s with the albums From a Whisper to a Scream and Southern Nights. It was during this time that he teamed with Labelle, and produced their highly acclaimed 1975 album Nightbirds, which spawned the Number One hit, \"Lady Marmalade\". The same year, Toussaint collaborated with Paul McCartney and Wings for their hit album Venus and Mars and played on the song Rock Show. Two years later, Glen Campbell covered Toussaint's \"Southern Nights\" and carried the song to Number One on the Pop, Country and Adult-Contemporary Charts. Along with many of his contemporaries, Toussaint found that interest in his compositions was rekindled when his work began to be sampled by hip hop artists in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and, in 2009, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. On May 9, 2011 he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nToussaint weathered Hurricane Katrina in the Astor Crowne Plaza Hotel. After the hurricane Toussaint left New Orleans for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and eventually settled in New York City. His first television appearance after the hurricane was on the September 7, 2005 episode of the Late Show with David Letterman, sitting in with Paul Shaffer and his CBS Orchestra. Toussaint performed regularly at Joe's Pub in New York City through 2009.\n\nThe River in Reverse, Toussaint's collaborative album with Elvis Costello, was released on 29 May 2006 in the UK on the Verve label, by Universal Classics and Jazz UCJ. It was recorded in Hollywood and, notably, in Toussaint's native New Orleans as the first major studio session to take place after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, Toussaint performed a duet with Paul McCartney of a song by fellow New Orleans musician and resident Fats Domino, \"I Want to Walk You Home\", as their contribution to Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard).\n\nIn 2008, Toussaint's song \"Sweet Touch of Love\" was used in a deodorant commercial for the Axe (Lynx) brand. The commercial won a Gold Lion at the 2008 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. In February 2008, Toussaint appeared on Le Show, the Harry Shearer show broadcast on NPR via KCRW. He appeared in London in August 2008, where he performed a gig at The Roundhouse. In October 2008 he performed at Festival New Orleans at The O2 alongside acts such as Dr. John and Buckwheat Zydeco. Sponsored by Quint Davis of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Philip Anschutz, the event was intended to promote New Orleans music and culture and to revive the once-lucrative tourist trade that had been almost completely lost following the flooding of Hurricane Katrina. After his second performance at the festival, Toussaint appeared alongside then-Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Mitch Landrieu. The following day, he performed again in London at the NFL Tailgate Party.\n\nToussaint performed for a taping of the PBS series Austin City Limits on June 30, 2009 during the show's 35th anniversary season. He played instrumentals from his then recent album, \"The Bright Mississippi\", as well as many songs from his back catalog. He performed with Levon Helm and his band on Imus in the Morning on October 9, 2009. In December 2009, he was featured on Elvis Costello's Spectacle program on the Sundance Channel, singing \"A Certain Girl\". Toussaint appeared on Eric Clapton's 2010 album, Clapton, in two Fats Waller covers, \"My Very Good Friend the Milkman\" and \"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful\".\n\nToussaint was a musical mentor to Swedish-born New Orleans songwriter and performer Theresa Andersson.\n\n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Amos Milburn": {
    "bio": "Amos Milburn (Houston, Texas, April 1, 1927 – January 3, 1980) was an American rhythm and blues singer and pianist, popular during the 1940s and 1950s. \n\nJoseph Amos Milburn, Jr., one of thirteen children, was playing tunes on the piano by the age of five years. He enlisted in the United States Navy when he was fifteen and earned thirteen battle stars in the Philippines, before returning to Houston and organizing a sixteen-piece band playing in Houston clubs and was Managed by William & Geneva Church. Milburn participated with the Houston jazz and blues musicians. He was a polished pianist and performer and during 1946 attracted the attention of a woman who arranged a recording session with Aladdin Records in Los Angeles, California. Milburn's relationship with Aladdin lasted eight years during which he produced more than 75 sides. His cover version of \"Down the Road a Piece\" (1946) was a blues song with a Texas boogie beat that was similar in many respects to rock music. However, none became popular until 1949 when seven of his singles got the attention of the R&B audience. \"Hold Me Baby\" and \"Chicken Shack Boogie\" landed numbers eight and nine on Billboard's survey of 1949's R&B Bestsellers. He became one of the main performers associated with the Central Avenue music scene in Los Angeles. He was also a popular touring artist, and won awards from both Down Beat magazine (Best Blues and Jazz Star) and Billboard magazine (Top R&B Artist). Among his best-known songs was \"One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer\". During 1950 Milburn's \"Bad, Bad, Whiskey\" scored the top of the R&B record chart and began a series of drinking songs (none written by Milburn, but several composed by Rudy Toombs). However, there is not any evidence that Milburn had an alcohol problem.\nMilburn continued his successful drinking songs through 1952 (\"Thinking and Drinking\", \"Trouble in Mind\") and was by now touring the country playing clubs. While touring the Midwest that summer, he announced that he would disband his combo team and continue as a solo act and that autumn he joined Charles Brown for a Southern concert tour. For the next few years each of his tours was composed of a series of one-nighters. After three years of solo performing he returned to Houston during 1956 to reform his band. During 1957 Milburn's releases with Aladdin Records did not sell well, and the record label, having its own problems, terminated. He tried to regain commercial success with a few more releases with Ace Records but his time had passed. Radio airplay was emphasizing on the teenage market.\nMilburn contributed to the R&B Yuletide canon twice. The first was in 1949, with \"Let's Make Christmas Merry, Baby\", on Aladdin Records, and then again during 1960 with \"Christmas (Comes but Once a Year)\" for King Records. The song appeared as the b-side of Brown's holiday classic \"Please Come Home for Christmas\".\nMilburn's final recording was for an album by Johnny Otis. This was during 1972 after he had been incapacitated by a stroke, so much so that Otis had to play the left-hand piano parts for his enfeebled old friend. His second stroke resulted in amputation of a leg because of circulatory problems. He died soon after at the age of 52 years from a third stroke.\n\nThe Texan boogie-woogie pianist and singer was an important performer of blues music during the years immediately after World War II. Milburn was one of the first performers to switch from sophisticated jazz arrangements to a louder \"jump\" blues. He began to emphasize rhythm and technical qualities of voice and instrumentation second. His energetic songs, about getting \"high\", were admired by fellow musicians, such as Little Willie Littlefield, Floyd Dixon and his prime disciple, Fats Domino.\nHe was a commercial success for eleven years and influenced many performers. Fats Domino credited Milburn consistently as an influence on his music.\n\nOne commentator noted, \"Milburn excelled at good-natured, upbeat romps about booze and partying, imbued with a vibrant sense of humour and double entendre, as well as vivid, down-home imagery in his lyrics.\"\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Andy Williams": {
    "bio": "Howard Andrew Williams (born December 3, 1927 in Wall Lake, Iowa, died September 26, 2012), known as Andy Williams, was an American pop singer.\n\nHe first performed in a children's choir at his local Presbyterian church. Williams and his three older brothers Bob, Dick, and Don, formed a quartet, the Williams Brothers, in the late 1930s.  The brothers performed on radio in the Midwest, first at WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, and later at WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati. Williams graduated from Western Hills High School in Cincinnati. They appeared with Bing Crosby on the hit record \"Swinging on a Star\" (1944). This led to a nightclub act with entertainer Kay Thompson from 1947 to 1951.\n\nWilliams's solo career began in 1952 after his brothers left the act. He recorded six sides for RCA's label \"X,\" but none of them were popular hits. After landing a spot as a regular on Steve Allen's Tonight Show in 1955, he was signed to a recording contract with Cadence Records, a small label in New York run by conductor Archie Bleyer. His third single, \"Canadian Sunset\" (1956) hit the Top Ten, and was soon followed his only Billboard #1 hit, \"Butterfly\" (a cover of a Charlie Gracie record on which Williams imitated Elvis Presley). More hits followed, including \"The Hawaiian Wedding Song,\" \"Are You Sincere,\" \"The Village of St. Bernadette,\" and \"Lonely Street,\" before Williams moved to Columbia Records in 1961, having moved from New York to Los Angeles. In terms of chart popularity, the Cadence era was Williams's peak although songs he introduced on Columbia became much bigger standards. Two top ten hits from the Cadence era, \"Butterfly\" and \"I Like Your Kind of Love\" were apparently believed to not suit Williams's later style; they were not included on a Columbia reissue of his Cadence greatest hits in the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Williams became one of the most popular vocalists in the country and signed what was to that time the biggest recording contract in history. He was primarily an album artist, and at one time he had earned more gold albums than any solo performer except Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. By 1973 he had earned as many as 17 gold album awards. Among his hit albums from this period were Moon River, Days of Wine and Roses (number one for 16 weeks in mid-1963), The Andy Williams Christmas Album, Dear Heart, The Shadow of Your Smile, Love, Andy, Get Together with Andy Williams, and Love Story. In these recordings Williams displays an incredible vocal technique along with an uncanny ability to make each song his very own, often rivaling or surpassing the version by the original artist. These attributes, along with his natural affinity for the music of the 1960s and early 1970s, combined to make him one of the premier easy listening singers of that era.\n\nWilliams forged an indirect collaborative relationship with Henry Mancini, although they never recorded together. Williams was asked to sing Mancini and Johnny Mercer's song \"Moon River\" at the 1962 Oscar Awards (where it won), and it quickly became Williams's theme song. This was repeated the next year with the pair's \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (which also won), Mancini's \"Dear Heart\" at the 1965 awards and \"The Sweetheart Tree\" (also written with Mercer) at the 1966 awards.\n\nWilliams also competed in the teenage-oriented singles market as well and had several charting hits including \"Can't Get Used to Losing You,\" \"Happy Heart,\" and \"Where Do I Begin\", the theme song from the 1970 blockbuster film, Love Story. Building on his experience with Allen and some short-term variety shows in the 1950s, he became the star of his own weekly television variety show in 1962. This series, The Andy Williams Show, won three Emmy Awards for outstanding variety program. Among his series regulars were the Osmond Brothers. He gave up the variety show in 1971 while it was still popular and retrenched to three specials per year. His Christmas specials, which appeared regularly until 1974 and intermittently from 1982 into the 1990s, were among the most popular of the genre. Williams has recorded eight Christmas albums over the years. He hosted the Grammy Awards for three consecutive years in the 1970s. He returned to television to do a syndicated half-hour series in 1976-77.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Williams gave up most of his touring schedule in order to open his own theatre in Branson, Missouri, the Andy Williams Moon River Theater. He continues to do 8 to 12 shows a week from September to December and occasionally makes tours of Europe earlier in the year.\n\nHis 1967 recording of \"Music to Watch Girls By\" was a surprise UK hit in 1999, when it reached number 9 after featuring in an advert (beating the original peak of number 33 in 1967). In 2002 he took part in a new duet of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" with British actress and singer Denise van Outen. Nearly everything Williams ever recorded has now been made available on CD through a series of compilations from 1997 to 2004.\n\nWilliams met Claudine Longet when he pulled over to aid her on a Las Vegas road. She was a dancer at the time at the Folies Bergere. They married on Christmas Day, 1961, and had three children, Noelle, Christian, and Robert. They separated in 1969 and finally divorced 6 years later. In 1976 Longet was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, skier Vladimir \"Spider\" Sabich and Williams supported her. He married a second time in May 1991 to the former Debbie Haas. They make their homes at Branson, Missouri and La Quinta, California. Williams' homes have been featured in Architectural Digest, and he is a noted collector of modern art. Williams is an avid golfer. He hosted a major golf tournament in San Diego for many years, which was known as the Andy Williams San Diego Open during that time.\n\nWilliams' birthplace is a tourist attraction open most of the year.

  "Aretha Franklin": {
    "bio": "Aretha Franklin (March 25, 1942 - August 16, 2018) was a Memphis, Tennessee born and Detroit, Michigan reared American iconic gospel, soul, and R&B singer, songwriter and pianist. Many have called her \"The Queen Of Soul\" and \"Lady Soul\".\n\nShe is renowned for her soul and R&B recordings (on many, of which, she accompanied herself on keyboards and piano, a skill she learned at an early age, learning to play by ear, according to lifetime friend Smokey Robinson) but was also adept at jazz, rock, blues, pop, and gospel.\n\nShe is generally regarded as one of the best vocalists ever by such industry publications and media outlets as Rolling Stone and VH1, due to her phenomenal technical and interpretative talents.\n\nAdept at the piano as well as having a gifted voice, Franklin became a child prodigy. By the age of fourteen, she signed a record deal with Battle Records, where her father Reverend C.L. Franklin recorded his sermons and gospel vocal recordings, and she issued Songs of Faith in 1956.\n\nShe is the second most honored female popular singer in Grammy history (after Alison Krauss), having won eighteen competitive Grammys (including an unprecedented eleven for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, eight of them consecutive). The state of Michigan has declared her voice to be a natural wonder.\n\nFranklin is perhaps best-known for her interpretation of Otis Redding's Respect, recorded in 1967 with sisters Carolyn Franklin and Erma Franklin. Many of her songs, however, were originals that have since been covered by other artists. Some of her best-known compositions include (Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone, Ain't No Way, All the King's Horses, Baby, Baby, Baby, Call Me, Dr. Feelgood, Rock Steady, Spirit in the Dark, and Think (which she performed in the film The Blues Brothers).\n\nOn March 25, 1942, Aretha Louise Franklin was born at 406 Lucy Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee, to Barbara (née Siggers) and Clarence LaVaughn \"C. L.\" Franklin. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Her parents both had children, three in total, from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York, when Aretha was two. Before her fifth birthday, in 1946, C. L. Franklin permanently relocated the family to Detroit, Michigan where he took over the pastorship of New Bethel Baptist Church. Aretha's parents had a troubled marriage due to stories of her father's philandering and in 1948, the couple separated, with Barbara relocating back to Buffalo with her son, Vaughn, from a previous relationship. Contrary to popular belief, her mother did not abandon her children; not only did Aretha recall seeing her mother in Buffalo during the summer, but Barbara also frequently visited her children in Detroit. Aretha's mother died of a heart attack on March 7, 1952, before Aretha's tenth birthday. The news of her mother's death was broken by her father, who had gathered Aretha and her siblings in the kitchen to tell them and that he \"could not have been more understanding.\" Several women, including Aretha's grandmother, Rachel, and Mahalia Jackson took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home. During this time, Aretha learned how to play piano by ear.\n\nAretha's father's emotionally driven sermons resulted in his being known as the man with the \"million-dollar voice\" and earning thousands of dollars for sermons in various churches across the country. His celebrity status led to his home being visited by various celebrities, among them gospel musicians Clara Ward, James Cleveland and early Caravans members Albertina Walker and Inez Andrews as well as Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke. Ward was not only a visitor to the home, but was romantically involved with Aretha's father, though \"she preferred to view them strictly as friends.\" Ward also served as a role model to the young Aretha. Franklin attended Northern High School but later dropped out during her sophomore year.\n\nMusic career\n\nBeginnings (1952–1960)\n\nJust after her mother's death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel, debuting with the hymn, \"Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me.\" When Franklin was 12, her father began managing her, bringing her on the road with him during his so-called \"gospel caravan\" tours for her to perform in various churches. He helped his daughter sign her first recording deal with J.V.B. Records, where her first album, Songs of Faith, was released in 1956. Franklin sometimes traveled with The Soul Stirrers during this time. In 1958, Franklin and her father traveled to California, where she met Sam Cooke. At the age of 16, Franklin went on tour with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and in 1968 sang at his funeral.\n\nAs a young gospel singer, Franklin spent summers on the circuit in Chicago, staying with Mavis Staples' family. After turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke in recording pop music, and moved to New York. Serving as her manager, C. L. agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of Columbia Records, who agreed to sign her in 1960. Franklin was signed as a \"five-percent artist\". During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer Cholly Atkins to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin's father to have his label, RCA, sign Franklin. He had also been courted by local record label owner Berry Gordy to sign Franklin and her elder sister Erma to his Tamla label. Franklin's father felt the label was not established enough yet. Franklin's first Columbia single, \"Today I Sing the Blues\", was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top ten of the Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers chart.\n\nInitial success (1961–1966)\n\nIn January 1961, Columbia issued Franklin's first secular album, Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo. The album featured her first single to chart the Billboard Hot 100, \"Won't Be Long\", which also peaked at number 7 on the R&B chart. Mostly produced by Clyde Otis, Franklin's Columbia recordings saw her performing in diverse genres such as standards, vocal jazz, blues, doo-wop and rhythm and blues. Before the year was out, Franklin scored her first top 40 single with her rendition of the standard, \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\", which also included the R&B hit, \"Operation Heartbreak\", on its b-side. \"Rock-a-Bye\" became her first international hit, reaching the top 40 in Australia and Canada. By the end of 1961, Franklin was named as a \"new-star female vocalist\" in DownBeat magazine. In 1962, Columbia issued two more albums, The Electrifying Aretha Franklin and The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin, the latter of which reached No. 69 on the Billboard chart.\n\nIn the 1960s during a performance at the Regal Theater, a WVON radio personality announced Franklin should be crowned, \"the Queen of Soul\". By 1964, Franklin began recording more pop music, reaching the top ten on the R&B chart with the ballad \"Runnin' Out of Fools\" in early 1965. She had two R&B charted singles in 1965 and 1966 with the songs \"One Step Ahead\" and \"Cry Like a Baby\", while also reaching the Easy Listening charts with the ballads \"You Made Me Love You\" and \"(No, No) I'm Losing You\". By the mid-1960s, Franklin was netting $100,000 from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters. Also during that period, she appeared on rock and roll shows such as Hollywood A Go-Go and Shindig!. However, she struggled with commercial success while at Columbia. Label executive John H. Hammond later said he felt Columbia did not understand Franklin's early gospel background and failed to bring that aspect out further during her period there.\n\nCommercial success (1967–1979)\n\nIn November 1966, after six years with Columbia, Franklin chose not to renew her contract with the company and signed to Atlantic Records. In January 1967, she traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to record at FAME Studios and recorded the song, \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\", backed by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Franklin only spent one day recording at FAME, as an altercation broke out between manager and husband Ted White, studio owner Rick Hall, and a horn player, and sessions were abandoned. The song was released the following month and reached number one on the R&B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Franklin her first top-ten pop single. The song's b-side, \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\", reached the R&B top 40, peaking at number 37. In April, Atlantic issued her frenetic version of Otis Redding's \"Respect\", which shot to number one on both the R&B and pop charts. \"Respect\" became her signature song and was later hailed as a civil rights and feminist anthem.\n\nFranklin's debut Atlantic album, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, also became commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top-ten singles in 1967, including \"Baby I Love You\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\". Her rapport with producer Jerry Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of Franklin's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums Lady Soul and Aretha Now, which included some of Franklin's most popular hit singles, including \"Chain of Fools\", \"Ain't No Way\", \"Think\" and \"I Say a Little Prayer\". That February, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys, including the debut category for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. On February 16, Franklin was honored with a day named for her and was greeted by longtime friend Martin Luther King Jr. who gave her the SCLC Drum Beat Award for Musicians just two months before his death. Franklin toured outside the US for the first time in May, including an appearance at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam where she played to a near hysterical audience who covered the stage with flower petals. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine in June.\n\nFranklin's success expanded during the early 1970s, during which she recorded top-ten singles such as \"Spanish Harlem\", \"Rock Steady\" and \"Day Dreaming\" as well as the acclaimed albums Spirit in the Dark, Young, Gifted and Black, and her gospel album, Amazing Grace, which sold more than two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R&B performer to headline Fillmore West, later that year releasing the live album Aretha Live at Fillmore West. Franklin's career began to experience problems while recording the album, Hey Now Hey, which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single \"Angel\", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&B success with songs such as \"Until You Come Back to Me\" and \"I'm in Love\", but by 1975 her albums and songs were no longer top sellers. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film Sparkle with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Franklin's final top 40 hit of the decade, \"Something He Can Feel\", which also peaked at number one on the R&B chart. Franklin's follow-up albums for Atlantic, including Sweet Passion (1977), Almighty Fire (1978) and La Diva (1979), bombed on the charts, and in 1979 Franklin opted to leave the company.\n\nLater years (1979–2018)\n\nIn 1980, after leaving Atlantic Records,[48] Franklin signed with Clive Davis's Arista Records and that same year gave a command performance at London's Royal Albert Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth. Franklin also had an acclaimed guest role as a waitress in the 1980 comedy musical The Blues Brothers.[49][50] Franklin's first Arista album, Aretha (1980), featured the No. 3 R&B hit \"United Together\" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Otis Redding's \"I Can't Turn You Loose\". The follow-up, 1981's Love All the Hurt Away, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson, while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam & Dave's \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\". Franklin achieved a gold record—for the first time in seven years—with the 1982 album Jump to It. The album's title track was her first top-40 single on the pop charts in six years.\n\nIn 1985, inspired by a desire to have a \"younger sound\" in her music, Who's Zoomin' Who? became her first Arista album to be certified platinum. The album sold well over a million copies thanks to the hits \"Freeway of Love\", the title track, and \"Another Night\". The following year's Aretha album nearly matched this success with the hit singles \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\", \"Jimmy Lee\" and \"I Knew You Were Waiting for Me\", her international number-one duet with George Michael. During that period, Franklin provided vocals to the theme songs of the TV shows A Different World and Together. In 1987, she issued her third gospel album, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, which was recorded at her late father's New Bethel church, followed by Through the Storm in 1989. Franklin's 1991 album, What You See is What You Sweat, flopped on the charts. She returned to the charts in 1993 with the dance song \"A Deeper Love\" and returned to the top 40 with the song \"Willing to Forgive\" in 1994.\n\nIn 1998, Franklin returned to the top 40 with the Lauryn Hill-produced song \"A Rose Is Still a Rose\", later issuing the album of the same name, which went gold. That same year, Franklin earned international acclaim for her performance of \"Nessun dorma\" at the Grammy Awards, filling in at the last minute for Luciano Pavarotti, who had cancelled after the show had already begun. Her final Arista album, So Damn Happy, was released in 2003 and featured the Grammy-winning song \"Wonderful\". In 2004, Franklin announced that she was leaving Arista after more than 20 years with the label. To complete her Arista obligations, Franklin issued the duets compilation album Jewels in the Crown: All-Star Duets with the Queen in 2007. The following year, she issued the holiday album This Christmas, Aretha, on DMI Records.\n\nFranklin performed The Star-Spangled Banner with Aaron Neville and Dr. John for Super Bowl XL, held in her hometown of Detroit in February 2006. She later made international headlines for performing \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" at President Barack Obama's inaugural ceremony with her church hat becoming a popular topic online. In 2010, Franklin accepted an honorary degree from Yale University. In 2011, under her own label, Aretha's Records, she issued the album Aretha: A Woman Falling Out of Love.\n\nIn 2014, Franklin was signed under RCA Records, controller of the Arista catalog and a sister label to Columbia via Sony Music Entertainment, and was working with Clive Davis. An album was planned with producers Babyface and Danger Mouse. On September 29, 2014, Franklin performed to a standing ovation, with Cissy Houston as backup, a compilation of Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. Franklin's cover of \"Rolling in the Deep\" was featured among nine other songs in her first RCA release, Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics, released in October 2014. In doing so, she became the first woman to have 100 songs on Billboard′s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with the success of her cover of Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep\", which debuted at number 47 on the chart.\n\n\nFranklin, waiting to perform at the White House in 2015\nIn December 2015, Franklin gave an acclaimed performance of \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors during the section for honoree Carole King, who co-wrote the song. During the bridge of the song, Franklin dropped her fur coat to the stage, for which the audience rewarded her with a mid-performance standing ovation. She returned to Detroit's Ford Field on Thanksgiving Day 2016 to once again perform the national anthem before the game between the Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions. Seated behind the piano, wearing a black fur coat and Lions stocking cap, Franklin gave a rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" that lasted more than four minutes and featured a host of improvizations. Franklin released the album A Brand New Me in November 2017 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which uses archived recordings from her past. It peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Top Classical Albums chart.\n\nMusic style and image\nAccording to Richie Unterberger, Franklin was \"one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged.\" She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to \"vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience\". Franklin's voice was described as being a \"powerful mezzo-soprano voice\". She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs. Describing Franklin's voice as a youngster on her first album, Songs of Faith, released in 1956 when she was just 14, Jerry Wexler explained that it \"was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant\".\n\nPersonal life\n\nAfter being raised in Detroit, Franklin relocated to New York City in the 1960s, where she lived until moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. She eventually settled in Encino, Los Angeles where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan to be close to her ailing father and siblings. Franklin maintained a residence there until her death. Following an incident in 1984, she cited a fear of flying that prevented her from traveling overseas; she performed only in North America afterwards. Franklin was the mother of four sons. She first became pregnant at the age of 12 and gave birth to her first child, named Clarence after her father, on January 28, 1955. According to the news site Inquisitr, \"The father of the child was Donald Burk, a boy she knew from school.\" On January 22, 1957, then aged 14, Franklin had a second child, named Edward after his father Edward Jordan. Franklin did not like to discuss her early pregnancies with interviewers.\n\nBoth children took her family name. While Franklin was pursuing her career and \"hanging out with [friends]\", Franklin's grandmother Rachel and sister Erma took turns raising the children. Franklin would visit them often. Franklin's third child, Ted White Jr., was born in February 1964 and is known professionally as Teddy Richards. He has provided guitar backing for his mother's band during live concerts. Her youngest son, Kecalf Cunningham was born in 1970 and is the child of her road manager Ken Cunningham.\n\nFranklin was married twice. Her first husband was Theodore \"Ted\" White, whom she married in 1961 at age 19. Franklin had actually seen White the first time at a party held at her house in 1954. After a contentious marriage that involved domestic violence, Franklin separated from White in 1968, divorcing him in 1969. Franklin then married her second husband, actor Glynn Turman, on April 11, 1978 at her father's church. By marrying Turman, Franklin became stepmother of Turman's three children from a previous marriage. Franklin and Turman separated in 1982 after Franklin returned to Michigan from California, and they divorced in 1984. At one point, Franklin had plans to marry her longtime companion Willie Wilkerson. Franklin and Wilkerson had had two previous engagements stretching back to 1988. Franklin eventually called the 2012 engagement off. Franklin's sisters, Erma and Carolyn, were professional musicians as well and spent years performing background vocals on Franklin's recordings. Following Franklin's divorce from Ted White, her brother Cecil became her manager, and maintained that position until his death from lung cancer on December 26, 1989. Sister Carolyn died the previous year in April 1988 from breast cancer, while eldest sister Erma died from throat cancer in September 2002. Franklin's step-brother Vaughn died two months after Erma in late 2002. Her half-sister, Carl Kelley (née Jennings; born 1940) is C. L. Franklin's daughter by Mildred Jennings, a then 12-year-old congregant of New Salem Baptist Church in Memphis, where C. L. was pastor.\n\nFranklin was performing at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, on June 10, 1979, when her father, C. L., was shot twice at point blank range in his Detroit home.[92] After six months at Henry Ford Hospital, still in a state of coma, C.L. was moved back to his home with 24-hour nursing care. Aretha moved back to Detroit in late 1982 to assist with the care of her father, who died at Detroit's New Light Nursing Home on July 27, 1984.[93] Some of her music business friends have included Dionne Warwick, Mavis Staples, and Cissy Houston, who began singing with Franklin as members of the Sweet Inspirations. Cissy sang background on Franklin's hit \"Ain't No Way\". Franklin first met Cissy's daughter, Whitney, in the early 1970s. She was made Whitney's honorary aunt, not a godmother as has been occasionally misreported, and Whitney often referred to her as \"Auntie Ree\".\n\nWhen Whitney Houston died on February 11, 2012, Franklin said she was surprised by her death. She had initially planned to perform at Houston's memorial service on February 18, but her representative claimed that Franklin suffered a leg spasm and was unable to attend. In response to criticism of her non-attendance, she stated, \"God knows I wanted to be there, but I couldn't.\"\nFranklin was a registered Democrat.\n\nHealth problems\nFranklin dealt with weight issues for years. In 1974, she dropped 40 pounds (18 kg) during a crash diet and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade.[100] She again lost weight in the early 1990s, before gaining some back. A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992. She admitted in 1994 that her smoking was \"messing with my voice\", but after quitting smoking she said later, in 2003, that her weight \"ballooned\".\n\nIn 2010, Franklin canceled a number of concerts, after she decided to have surgery for an undisclosed tumor. Discussing the surgery in 2011, she quoted her doctor as saying that it would \"add 15 to 20 years\" to her life. She denied that the ailment had anything to do with pancreatic cancer, as had been rumored. On May 19, 2011, Franklin had her comeback show in the Chicago Theatre. In May 2013, she canceled two performances to deal with an undisclosed medical treatment. Later the same month, she canceled three June concerts and planned to return to perform in July. A show scheduled for July 27 in Clarkston, Michigan was canceled due to continued medical treatment. In addition, she canceled an appearance at a Major League Baseball luncheon in Chicago honoring her commitment to civil rights on August 24. She also canceled a performance of September 21 in Atlanta due to her health recovery. During a phone interview with the Associated Press in late August 2013, Franklin stated that she had a \"miraculous\" recovery from her undisclosed illness but had to cancel shows and appearances until her health was at 100%, estimating she was about \"85% healed\". Franklin later returned to live performing, including a 2013 Christmas concert at Detroit's MotorCity Casino Hotel. She launched a multi-city tour in mid-2014, starting with a performance on June 14 in New York at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nIn 2017, Franklin canceled a series of concerts due to health reasons. During an outdoor Detroit show, she asked the audience to \"keep me in your prayers\". In July 2017, Franklin reemerged, appearing to have lost more weight before a performance at the Wolf Trap in Virginia. In 2018, she canceled a series of shows, citing doctor's orders. Franklin's final performance was at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York City during Elton John's 25th anniversary gala for the Elton John AIDS Foundation on November 7, 2017.\n\nFinal illness and death\nOn August 13, 2018, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home in Riverfront Towers, Detroit. She was reported to be under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder, Jesse Jackson, and ex-husband Glynn Turman, among others, visited her on her deathbed. Franklin died at her home on August 16, 2018, aged 76. The cause was reported to be pancreatic cancer. Numerous celebrities in the entertainment industry and politicians paid tribute to Franklin, including former U.S. president Barack Obama who said she \"helped define the American experience\". Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton called her a \"civil rights and humanitarian icon\".\n\nA private funeral was arranged for August 31, following a two-day public viewing of Franklin's casket at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit.\n\nLegacy and honors\n\nFranklin wipes a tear after being given the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005, at the White House. She is seated between fellow recipients Robert Conquest (left) and Alan Greenspan.\nFranklin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1979, had her voice declared a Michigan \"natural resource\" in 1985, and became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded her a Grammy Legend Award in 1991, then the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. Franklin was a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1994, recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 1999, and was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. She was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nFranklin became the second woman inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. She was the 2008 MusiCares Person of the Year, performing at the Grammys days later. Following news of Franklin's surgery and recovery in February 2011, the Grammys ceremony paid tribute to the singer with a medley of her classics performed by Christina Aguilera, Florence Welch, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, and Yolanda Adams. That same year she was ranked 19th among the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time top artists, and ranked first on the Rolling Stone list of Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2013, she was again ranked first in Rolling Stone magazine's \"100 Greatest Singers\" list. Inducted to the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2012, Franklin was described as \"the voice of the civil rights movement, the voice of black America\" and a \"symbol of black equality\". Asteroid 249516 Aretha was named in her honor in 2014.\n\n\"American history wells up when Aretha sings,\" President Obama explained in response to her performance of \"A Natural Woman\" at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors. \"Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R&B, rock and roll—the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope\". On June 8, 2017, the City of Detroit honored Franklin's legacy by renaming a portion of Madison Street, between Brush and Witherell Streets, \"Aretha Franklin Way\". On January 29, 2018, The Oakland Press′s correspondent Gary Graff confirmed that the American Idol runner-up Jennifer Hudson will take the role to play Franklin in her coming biopic. The news was announced by the film's executive producer Clive Davis, who made public their decision on the choice of actors casting in the film two days before Graff's article was published. An all-star tribute concert to Franklin, celebrating her music, is scheduled for November 14, 2018, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nHonorary degrees\nFranklin received an honorary degree from Harvard University in 2014, as well as honorary doctorates in music from Princeton University, 2012; Yale University, 2010; Brown University, 2009; University of Pennsylvania, 2007; Berklee College of Music, 2006; New England Conservatory of Music, 1997; and University of Michigan, 1987. Franklin was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Wayne State University in 1990 and an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Bethune–Cookman University in 1975.\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Arthur Alexander": {
    "bio": "Arthur Alexander (May 10, 1940 – June 9, 1993), born in Florence, Alabama, was perhaps one of the biggest stars to arise out of the American country-soul scene. Working with Muscle Shoals, a pioneering record label, Alexander's \"You Better Move On\" was the label's first hit and perhaps his best-known song, covered by The Rolling Stones. \"Anna (Go to Him)\" a US rhythm and blues Top Ten Hit (covered by The Beatles), \"Soldier of Love\" (covered by The Beatles, Marshall Crenshaw and Pearl Jam) and \"Set Me Free\" (covered by Esther Phillips and Joe Tex) were also major hits and established Alexander as a pioneering arranger of others' tunes, as well as an established songwriter in his own right. He switched to another label, Sound Stage 7 founded by Fred Foster, and although a 1972 album for Warner Brothers was promising, the singer's potential seemed to wither. He secured a pop hit with \"Every Day I Have To Cry\" on Buddah Records (1975), but the success remained shortlived. For many years, Alexander was out of the music business; he was a bus driver for much of this time. He began to perform again in 1993 as renewed interest was shown in his small but important catalogue. His last album \"Lonely Just Like Me\" was his first in 21 years. He signed a new recording/publishing contract in May 1993 but suffered the cruelest fate when he collapsed and died of a heart attack the following month, three days after performing in Nashville with his new band.\n\nArthur Alexander deserves a special mention in pop and rock history for his particular influence, as indicated, on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. It is believed that John Lennon, in particular, was heavily influenced in his singing style by Arthur Alexander. The above-mentioned tracks such as 'Anna', 'You Better Move On' and 'Soldier of Love', in particular, but maybe also 'Go Home Girl' might confirm this artist's influence on the Beatles and his influence, if the listener needs further convincing after hearing 'You Better Move On', on the Rolling Stones.

    "bio": "Arthur Lee Conley (January 4, 1946 – November 17, 2003) was an American soul singer.  He is best known for the 1967 hit Sweet Soul Music which shot to the number two spot on both the pop and R&B charts in America, earning Conley the number eleven male artist ranking for 1967.  The song pays homage to great soul singers like Lou Rawls, Wilson Pickett and James Brown.\n\nConley was born in McIntosh County, Georgia and grew up in Atlanta. He first recorded in 1959 as the lead singer of Arthur & the Corvets. With this group he released three singles from 1963 through 1964 (Poor Girl, I Believe, and Flossie Mae) on the Atlanta-based label National Recording Company.\n\nIn 1964 he moved to a new label (Ru-Jac Records) and released I'm a Lonely Stranger.  When Otis Redding heard it he asked Conley to record a new version, which became the second release on Redding's own fledgling label Jotis Records.\n\nConley met Otis Redding in 1967.  After this meeting Redding took Conley under his care and taught him the fine points of the music business. Together they rewrote the Sam Cooke song Yeah Man into Sweet Soul Music, which at Redding's insistence was released on the Atco-distributed label Fame Records. It proved a massive hit and went to the number two position on the U.S. charts and the Top Ten across much of Europe. It is said that Conley never accepted Otis Redding's death of December 1967.\n\nAfter several years of lackluster singles in the early 1970s he relocated to England in 1975 and then spent several years in Belgium before settling in the Dutch village of Ruurlo and the cultural centre of Ganzenhoef (an extension southeast of Amsterdam) in 1980.  He legally changed his name to Lee Roberts (his middle name and his mother's maiden name).  He occupied himself with promoting new music by means of his Art-Con Productions company and was also active as a designer of specialized tapestries and furniture.\n\nA live performance on January 8, 1980 featuring Lee Roberts & the Sweaters was released as an album titled Soulin' in 1988.\n\nHe died after a long battle with intestinal cancer in Ruurlo, Netherlands at age 57.

  "Ashley Monroe": {
    "bio": "Ashley Monroe (born Ashley Lauren Monroe on September 10, 1986, in Knoxville, Tennessee) is an American country music singer-songwriter. \n\nGrowing up, her parents played songs by the Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd, so her country rock roots started early, and she was already taking piano lesson before she turned seven. At age 11, she won a talent contest in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee (home of Dolly Parton's resort \"Dollywood\"), singing \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart.\"  She subsequently found steady work performing in a theater in Pigeon Forge. A couple year later, her father gave Monroe her first guitar, and she began writing her own songs. But tragedy struck when her father died from cancer in 2000. While still grieving over their loss, Monroe and her mother continued on with their lives and moved to Nashville so she could pursue her career in music.\n\nAfter a year in Nashville, she gained a publishing deal as a songwriter, which led to a record contract with Columbia Records' Nashville division. Working with producer Mark Wright, she recorded her debut album, Satisfied. In 2006, the title track to the album was released as the first single to country radio, but failed to crack the top 40 on the Hot Country Songs chart. A second single, \"I Don't Want To\" featuring Ronnie Dunn of Brooks & Dunn, followed shortly after. Initially it did well on the charts, charting to #37, but following the merger of Columbia and Sony, the label decided not to release the album until Monroe charted a top 20 single. No follow-up singles were ever released. iTunes briefly made the album available for download in July 2006 but it was removed from the online store by mid-August.\n\nIn late 2007, Monroe and Columbia Records parted ways, and Satisfied was shelved (it was eventually released digitally in May of 2009). In addition to her own material, she co-wrote Katrina Elam's 2007 single \"Flat on the Floor\" (which was also recorded by Carrie Underwood on her 2007 album Carnival Ride), as well as Jason Aldean's 2009 single, \"The Truth\", and Miranda Lambert's 2011 single, \"Heart Like Mine.\"\n\nMonroe continued collaborating with Lambert, forming Pistol Annies with Lambert and Angaleena Presley in 2011. They released the single \"Hell on Heels\" in May of that year, following up with an album of the same name in August. Hell on Heels debuted at number 1 on Billboard's Country Album Chart and reached number 5 on the Billboard 200 Chart. \n\nMonroe next teamed up with producer Vince Gill, and on March 5, 2013, Warner Nashville released Monroe's second studio album, Like A Rose.

  "B.B. King": {
    "bio": "B. B. King (b. September 16, 1925 in Itta Bena, Mississippi; died May 14, 2015 in Las Vegas) was a U.S. blues guitarist and songwriter. He is among the most respected electric guitarists; Rolling Stone magazine ranked him third in its list of the hundred greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nBorn as Riley B. King, he began broadcasting his music live on a Memphis radio station called WDIA. At first, he used the name The Peptikon Boy on air, which later was changed to The Beale Street Blues Boy, and then further shortened to just Blues Boy or B.B.\n\nKing's first hit on the R&B charts was \"Three o'Clock in the Morning\" in 1951. He first found success outside the blues market with the 1968 remake of the Roy Hawkins tune, \"The Thrill Is Gone\", which became a hit on both pop and R&B charts, a rare feat. King's mainstream success continued throughout the 1970s with songs like \"To Know You Is to Love You\" and \"I Like to Live the Love\". From 1951 to 1985, King appeared on Billboard's R&B charts seventy-four times.\n\nKing continued to record until his 80's, compilations of classic songs with other top artists, and new collaborative material with artists like Eric Clapton.\n\nFurther facts:\nEarly life\n\nKing was born in a cabin on a cotton plantation outside of Berclair, Mississippi, to Albert King and Nora Ella Farr on September 16, 1925. In 1930, his father left the family, and his mother married another man. King was raised by his maternal grandmother Elnora Farr in Kilmichael, Mississippi.[8]\nAs a kid, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. It seems that at the age of 12, he purchased his first guitar for $15.00,[8] although another source indicates he was given his first guitar by Bukka White, his mother's first cousin (King's grandmother and White's mother were sisters).[9] In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John's Quartet of Inverness, Mississippi, performing at area churches and on WGRM in Greenwood, Mississippi.\nIn 1946, King followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months. However, King shortly returned to Mississippi, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's Spot became so popular, it was expanded and became the Sepia Swing Club.\nInitially he worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, gaining the nickname Beale Street Blues Boy, which was later shortened to Blues Boy and finally to B.B. It was there that he first met T-Bone Walker. \"Once I'd heard him for the first time, I knew I'd have to have [an electric guitar] myself. 'Had' to have one, short of stealing!\", he said.\nCareer\n\n1949–2005\nIn 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angeles-based RPM Records. Many of King's early recordings were produced by Sam Phillips, who later founded Sun Records. Before his RPM contract, King had debuted on Bullet Records by issuing the single \"Miss Martha King\" (1949), which did not chart well. \"My very first recordings [in 1949] were for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company,\" King recalls. \"I had horns that very first session. I had Phineas Newborn on piano; his father played drums, and his brother, Calvin, played guitar with me. I had Tuff Green on bass, Ben Branch on tenor sax, his brother, Thomas Branch, on trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis.\n\n\nPerforming with his famous guitar, Lucille\nKing assembled his own band; the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone), George Coleman (tenor saxophone),[17] Floyd Newman (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), George Joyner (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). Onzie Horne was a trained musician elicited as an arranger to assist King with his compositions. By his own admission, he cannot play chords well[18] and always relies on improvisation. This was followed by tours across the USA with performances in major theaters in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and St. Louis, as well as numerous gigs in small clubs and juke joints of the southern US states.\nIn the winter of 1949, King played at a dance hall in Twist, Arkansas. In order to heat the hall, a barrel half-filled with kerosene was lit, a fairly common practice at the time. During a performance, two men began to fight, knocking over the burning barrel and sending burning fuel across the floor. The hall burst into flames, which triggered an evacuation. Once outside, King realized that he had left his guitar inside the burning building. He entered the blaze to retrieve his beloved instrument, a Gibson hollow electric. The next day, King learned that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. King named that first guitar Lucille, as well as every one he owned since that experience, as a reminder never again to do something as stupid as run into a burning building for a replaceable guitar.\nKing meanwhile toured the entire \"Chitlin' circuit\" and 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked. The same year he founded his own record label, Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he produced artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury.\nIn the 1950s, B.B. King became one of the most important names in R&B music, amassing an impressive list of hits including \"3 O'Clock Blues\",[14] \"You Know I Love You,\" \"Woke Up This Morning,\" \"Please Love Me,\" \"When My Heart Beats like a Hammer,\" \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"You Upset Me Baby,\" \"Every Day I Have the Blues\", \"Sneakin' Around,\" \"Ten Long Years,\" \"Bad Luck,\" \"Sweet Little Angel\", \"On My Word of Honor,\" and \"Please Accept My Love.\" King was extremely busy during this period and made 342 appearances and 3 recording sessions in 1956 alone. In 1962, King signed to ABC-Paramount Records, which was later absorbed into MCA Records, and this hence into his current label, Geffen Records. In November 1964, King recorded the Live at the Regal album at the Regal Theater in Chicago, Illinois.\nKing won a 1970 Grammy Award for the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\"; his version became a hit on both the pop and R&B charts, which was rare during that time for an R&B artist. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. He gained further visibility among rock audiences as an opening act on The Rolling Stones' 1969 American Tour. King's mainstream success continued throughout the 1970s with songs like \"To Know You is to Love You\" and \"I Like to Live the Love\".\nKing was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2004 he was awarded the international Polar Music Prize, given to artists \"in recognition of exceptional achievements in the creation and advancement of music.\"\n\n\nB.B. King in concert in France 1989\nFrom the 1980s onward he has continued to maintain a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing 300 nights a year. In 1988, King reached a new generation of fans with the single \"When Love Comes to Town\", a collaborative effort between King and the Irish band U2 on their Rattle and Hum album. Also that year King played for the 1988 Republican National Convention at the behest of the notorious Republican operative Lee Atwater. King has remained friendly with the Bush Family ever since and in 1990 was awarded the Presidential Medal of the Arts by George H.W. Bush and the Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush in 2008. In 2000, King teamed up with guitarist Eric Clapton to record Riding With the King. In 1998, King appeared in The Blues Brothers 2000, playing the part of the lead singer of the Louisiana Gator Boys, along with Clapton, Dr. John, Koko Taylor and Bo Diddley.\n2006–present: farewell tour and later activities[edit]\nOn 2006, King went on a \"farewell\" world tour, although he has been active ever since it ended. partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, with whom King had previously toured and recorded, including the song \"Since I Met You Baby\". It started in the UK, and continued with performances in the Montreux Jazz Festival and in Zürich at the Blues at Sunset. During his show in Montreux at the Stravinski Hall he jammed with Joe Sample, Randy Crawford, David Sanborn, Gladys Knight, Lella James, Andre Beeka, Earl Thomas, Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin, Barbara Hendricks and George Duke. The European leg of the Farewell Tour ended in Luxembourg on September 19, 2006, at the D'Coque Arena (support act: Todd Sharpville). In November and December, King played six times in Brazil.\nIn June 2006, King was present at a memorial of his first radio broadcast at the Three Deuces Building in Greenwood, Mississippi, where an official marker of the Mississippi Blues Trail was erected. The same month, a groundbreaking was held for a new museum, dedicated to King.[21] in Indianola, Mississippi.[22] The B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center opened on September 13, 2008. In late October 2006, he recorded a concert CD and DVD entitled B.B. King: Live at his B.B. King Blues Clubs in Nashville and Memphis. The four-night production featured his regular B.B. King Blues Band and captured his show as he performs it nightly around the world. It was his first live performance recording in 14 years.\n\n\nB.B.

  "Beach Boys": {
    "bio": "The Beach Boys is an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The original lineup included brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Known for their vocal harmonies and lyrics often centered on youth culture, the band drew influence from older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and rhythm and blues. Under Brian Wilson's leadership, their music sometimes incorporated elements of classical and jazz, as well as experimental recording techniques.\n\nInitially managed by the Wilsons' father, Murry Wilson, the group gained national recognition in 1963 with the release of \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" The song marked the beginning of a series of top-ten singles associated with the \"California sound,\" a style reflecting themes of surfing, cars, and romance. The Beach Boys were among the few American bands to maintain commercial success during the British Invasion. Beginning with the 1965 album \"The Beach Boys Today!\", the band shifted focus from surf-themed content to more introspective lyrics and complex arrangements. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" and the single \"Good Vibrations\" were significant in establishing the group's reputation for musical innovation. Plans for a follow-up album, \"Smile,\" were abandoned in 1967, after which Brian Wilson reduced his involvement in the band.\n\nThe band's popularity in the United States declined in the late 1960s, and their work was often overlooked by contemporary music critics at the time. In the early 1970s, the group underwent a change in public perception and musical direction, with Carl Wilson assuming a leadership role. During the mid-1970s, the group increasingly focused on live performances and retrospective compilations. Dennis Wilson died in 1983, and Brian Wilson later distanced himself from the band. Following Carl Wilson's death from lung cancer in 1998, Mike Love obtained legal rights to tour under the group's name. In the early 2010s, the surviving original members briefly reunited for a 50th anniversary tour. As of the 2020s, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine do not perform with the touring version of the Beach Boys led by Mike Love, though they are still officially considered members.\n\nThe Beach Boys have sold over 100 million records globally. Their work has had an influence on a variety of musical genres, including psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi. From the 1960s through the 2020s, the group achieved 37 Top 40 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, including four number-one hits. In 2004, they were ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest artists of all time. Albums such as \"The Beach Boys Today!\", \"Pet Sounds,\" \"Smiley Smile,\" \"Sunflower,\" and \"Surf's Up\" have been frequently cited in critics' polls. The original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Additional members over the years have included David Marks, Bruce Johnston, Blondie Chaplin, and Ricky Fataar.\n\nOn June 11th 2025, Brian Wilson died at the age of 82.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\n\nStudio albums\nSurfin' Safari (1962)\nSurfin' U.S.A.

  "Ben E. King": {
    "bio": "Ben E. King (born Benjamin Earl Nelson in Henderson, North Carolina), on 28 September 1938; died of natural causes on April 30 2015) was an American soul and pop singer and composer remembered as one of the principal lead singers of the R&B vocal group The Drifters, singing the lead vocals on three of their biggest hit singles: \"There Goes My Baby\", \"This Magic Moment\", and \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (their only US No. 1 hit) and for co-writing \"Stand by Me\", a US top ten hit in both 1961 and 1986. \n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, as a member of The Drifters, and has been nominated as a solo artist. Along with The Drifters' \"There Goes My Baby\", King's songs \"Stand by Me\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" also appear on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Additionally, he was inducted alongside The Drifters into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 with the Towering song award. \n\nIn 1958, Ben Nelson joined a doo wop group, The Five Crowns. Later that same year, The Drifters' manager fired the members of the group and replaced them with The Five Crowns, who had performed several engagements with The Drifters. He co-wrote the first hit by the new version of The Drifters, \"There Goes My Baby\" (1959). He also sang lead, using his birth name, on \"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" a song written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, \"Dance With Me,\" \"This Magic Moment,\" \"I Count the Tears,\" and other The Drifters hits.\n\nIn 1960 he left the group after failing to gain a salary increase and a fairer share of the group's royalties. At this point he assumed the more memorable stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining on Atlantic, King scored his first solo hit with the stylish, Latin-tinged ballad \"Spanish Harlem\" (1961). \"Stand by Me\" was his next recording. \"Stand by Me\", written by King along with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller was voted one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. \"Stand by Me\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" were named as two of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and were both also given a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.\n\nKing's records continued to place well on the pop charts until 1963, when British pop bands began to dominate the popular music scene. His hits after 1963 were \"What is Soul?\" (1967), \"Supernatural Thing, part 1\" (1975), and the re-issue in 1986 of \"Stand by Me\" following the song's use as the theme music to the movie of the same name.

In 1972 her album A Child of the Seventies was shelved by Atlantic Records, then thought lost forever in a fire. She eked out a living on the European festival circuit, occasionally surfacing such as with the disco single \"Doin' the Best that I Can\", but remained obscure until French soul collector Gilles Petard tracked down the lost masters and persuaded Atlantic to let him release them on his vanity label as Souvenirs. A live album and 2005's cover album I've Got My Own Hell to Raise followed.\n\nWith the release of The Scene of the Crime, Bettye Lavette inches closer to the mainstream, or at least a much bigger cult following. Backed by The Drive-by Truckers and released on -Anti, The Scene of the Crime is recorded at the legendary FAME studios in Muscles Shoals, Alabama. The same place as her lost album. The connection doesn't end there - Patterson Hood of the Drive-by Truckers is the son of David Hood, who played on the 1972 album.\n\nIn 2009, she appeared at President Barack Obama's Inaugural Celebration, singing \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with Jon Bon Jovi.

  "Big Bopper": {
    "bio": "Jiles Perry (J.P.) Richardson, Jr. (October 24, 1930 – February 3, 1959), called Jape by friends but commonly known as The Big Bopper, was a disc jockey who parlayed a big voice and exuberant personality into a career as an early rock and roll star. He is best known for his hit song \"Chantilly Lace\".\n\nRichardson was born in Sabine Pass, Texas, the oldest son of Jiles Perry, Sr. and Elise (Stalsby) Richardson. His father was an oil field worker and driller. He had two younger brothers, Cecil and James. Within a short time the family moved to Beaumont, Texas. He graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and was a member of the \"Royal Purple\" football team, wearing number \"85\" as a defensive lineman.\n\nRichardson later studied law at Lamar College, and was a member of the band and chorus. During this time he worked part time at KTRM radio, where in 1949 he was hired full-time and left school. On April 18, 1952, Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou from Montegut, Louisiana; in December 1953 their daughter, Debra Joy, was born. Earlier that year Richardson was promoted to Supervisor of Announcers at KTRM. In March 1955 he was drafted into the United States Army. His basic training was at Fort Ord, California after which Richardson spent two years as a radar instructor at Fort Bliss, Texas. Upon his discharge at the rank of Corporal in March 1957, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the \"Dishwashers' Serenade\" shift from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nOne of the station's sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot and suggested a gimmick for the show. Richardson noticed all the college kids doing a dance called The Bop, so he decided to become known as \"The Big Bopper\". He kicked off a new radio show from 3 to 6 p.m., and soon The Big Bopper became the station's program director.\n\nIn May of 1957, he broke the record for continuous on-the-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He went a total of five days, two hours and eight minutes, playing 1,821 records and taking showers during five-minute newscasts. During the marathon, he lost 35 pounds (16 kg). KTRM paid Richardson $746.50 for his overtime and he quickly hit the sack for 20 hours.\n\nAccording to the Internet Accuracy Project website, Richardson is credited with coining the term \"rock video\".\n\nAround this time, Richardson -- who played guitar -- started writing more songs. George Jones later recorded Richardson's \"White Lightning\", which became Jones' first #1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote \"Running Bear\" for Johnny Preston, his friend from Port Arthur, Texas. Inspiration for the song came from Richardson's childhood memory of the Sabine river, where he heard stories about Indian tribes. Jape sang background on \"Running Bear\", but it wasn't released until September 1959, after his death. Within several months it went to #1.\n\nThe man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was Harold \"Pappy\" Dailey from Houston. Dailey was promotion director for Mercury and Starday records and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson's first single, \"Beggar To A King\", had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action. He soon cut \"Chantilly Lace\" as \"The Big Bopper\" for Pappy Dailey's D label. Mercury bought the recording and released it during the summer of 1958. It reached #6 on the pop charts and spent 22 weeks on the national Top 40. It also inspired an answer record by Jayne Mansfield titled \"That Makes It\". In \"Chantilly Lace\", Richardson pretends to have a flirting phone call with his girlfriend; the Mansfield record suggests what his girlfriend might have been saying at the other end of the line.\n\nWith the success of \"Chantilly Lace,\" Richardson took some time off from KTRM radio and joined Buddy Holly and The Crickets, Ritchie Valens and Dion & the Belmonts for a \"Winter Dance Party\" tour. On February 2, 1959, Buddy Holly chartered a Beechcraft Bonanza to take him and his new Crickets band (Tommy Allsup and Waylon Jennings) to Fargo, North Dakota. Richardson came down with the flu and didn't feel comfortable on the bus, so Jennings gave his plane seat to Richardson. Valens had never flown on a small plane and requested Allsup's seat. They flipped a coin, and Valens called heads and won the toss.\n\nIn the early morning of February 3, after a performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, the small four-passenger Beechcraft Bonanza took off from the Mason City airport during a blinding snow storm and crashed into Albert Juhl’s corn field several miles after takeoff at 1:05 a.m. The crash killed Holly, Valens, Richardson and the 21-year-old pilot, Roger Peterson. This event would become known as \"The Day the Music Died\".\n\nRichardson, 28 when he died, left behind his wife, Adrianne, and 4-year-old daughter Debra Joy; a son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born in April of 1959. At the time of his death, Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in Beaumont, Texas, and was also planning to invest in the ownership of a radio station. In addition, he had written 20 new songs with plans to record by himself and with other artists. Richardson was a well-loved figure who was known to care deeply about his family.\n\nSon Jay P. Richardson took up a musical career inspired by his late father and is known professionally as \"The Big Bopper, Jr.\" He has performed at venues around the world. Notably, he has toured on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the very same stages as his father.\n\nIn film, The Big Bopper has been portrayed by Gailard Sartain in The Buddy Holly Story and Stephen Lee in La Bamba.\n\nMonument at Crash Site, September 16, 2003.  In 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the ’50s era, erected a stainless steel monument depicting a steel guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers. It is located on private farmland, about one quarter mile west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, approximately eight miles north of Clear Lake, this is where the plane crash was situated. He also created a similar stainless steel monument to the three musicians near the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin. That memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.\n\nJ.P. Richardson's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&B and rock'n'roll.

  "Billie Holiday": {
    "bio": "Billie Holiday (Eleanora Fagan Gough, Philadelphia, PA, April 7, 1915 – New York City, NY, July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.\n\nNicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner Lester Young, Holiday was a highly original influence on jazz and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and intimate approach to singing. She co-wrote only a few songs, but several of them have become jazz standards, notably \"God Bless the Child,\" \"Don't Explain,\" and \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including \"Easy Living\" and \"Strange Fruit.\"\nMusic critic Robert Christgau called her \"uncoverable, possibly the greatest singer of the century\".\nCritic John Bush wrote that she \"changed the art of American pop vocals forever.\"\n\nBillie Holiday had a difficult childhood, which greatly affected her life and career. Not much is known about the true details of her early life, though stories of it appeared in her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, first published in 1956 and later revealed to contain many inaccuracies.\n\nHer professional pseudonym was taken from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", presumably to distance herself from her neglectful father, but eventually changed it back to \"Holiday\".\n\nThere is some controversy regarding Holiday's paternity, stemming from a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives that lists the father as a \"Frank DeViese\". Some historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.\n\nThrown out of her parents' home in Baltimore after becoming pregnant at thirteen, Billie's mother, Sadie Fagan, moved to Philadelphia where Billie was born. Mother and child eventually settled in a poor section of Baltimore. Her parents married when she was three, but they soon divorced, leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives. At the age of 10, she reported that she had been raped. That claim, combined with her frequent truancy, resulted in her being sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school, in 1925. It was only through the assistance of a family friend that she was released two years later. Scarred by these experiences, Holiday moved to New York City with her mother in 1928. In 1929 Holiday's mother discovered a neighbor, Wilbert Rich, in the act of raping her daughter; Rich was sentenced to three months in jail.\n\nAccording to Billie Holiday's own account, she was recruited by a brothel, worked as a prostitute in 1930, and was eventually imprisoned for a short time for solicitation. It was in Harlem, New York in the early 1930s that she started singing for tips in various night clubs. According to legend, penniless and facing eviction, she sang \"Travelin All Alone\" in a local club and reduced the audience to tears. She later worked at various clubs for tips, ultimately landing at Pod's and Jerry's, a well known Harlem jazz club. Her early work history is hard to verify, though accounts say she was working at a club named Monette's in 1933 when she was discovered by talent scout John Hammond.\n\nHammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut in November 1933 with Benny Goodman singing two songs: \"Your Mother's Son-In-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch.\" Goodman was also on hand in 1935, when she continued her recording career with a group led by pianist Teddy Wilson. Their first collaboration included \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown To You,\" which helped to establish Holiday as a major vocalist. She began recording under her own name a year later, producing a series of extraordinary performances with groups comprising the Swing Era's finest musicians.\n\nWilson was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond for the purpose of recording current pop tunes in the new Swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were given free rein to improvise the material. Holiday's amazing method of improvising the melody line to fit the emotion was revolutionary. (Wilson and Holiday took pedestrian pop tunes like \"Twenty-Four Hours A Day\" or \"Yankee Doodle Never Went To Town\" and turned them into jazz classics with their arrangements.) With few exceptions, the recordings she made with Wilson or under her own name during the 1930s and early 1940s are regarded as important parts of the jazz vocal library.\n\nBillie also wrote songs during the 1930s. Such songs include \"Billie's Blues\", \"Tell Me More (And Then Some)\", \"Everything Happens For The Best\", \"Our Love Is Different\", and \"Long Gone Blues\".\n\nAmong the musicians who accompanied her frequently was tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom she had a special rapport. \"Well, I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices, if you don't be careful, you know, or the same mind, or something like that.\"[9] Young nicknamed her \"Lady Day\" and she, in turn, dubbed him \"Prez.\" She did a three-month residency at Clark Monroe's Uptown House in New York in 1937. In the late 1930s, she also had brief stints as a big band vocalist with Count Basie (1937) and Artie Shaw (1938). The latter association placed her among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an arrangement that went against the tenor of the times.\n\nHoliday was recording for Columbia in the late 1930s when she was introduced to \"Strange Fruit\", a song based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. Meeropol used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings. It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, proprietor of Café Society, an integrated nightclub in Greenwich Village, who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939, with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. Holiday later said that the imagery in \"Strange Fruit\" reminded her of her father's death, and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it. In a 1958 interview, she also bemoaned the fact that many people did not grasp the song's message: \"They'll ask me to 'sing that sexy song about the people swinging'\", she said.\n\nWhen Holiday's producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, Milt Gabler agreed to record it for his Commodore Records. That was done in April, 1939 and \"Strange Fruit\" remained in her repertoire for twenty years. She later recorded it again for Verve. While the Commodore release did not get airplay, the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record's other side, \"Fine and Mellow\", which was a jukebox hit.\n\nIn addition to owning Commodore Records, Milt Gabler was an A&R man for Decca Records, and he signed Holiday to the label in 1944. Her first recording for Decca, \"Lover Man\", was a song written especially for her by Jimmy Davis, Roger \"Ram\" Ramirez, and Jimmy Sherman. Although its lyrics describe a woman who has never known love (\"I long to try something I never had\"), its theme—a woman longing for a missing lover—and its refrain, \"Lover man, oh, where can you be?\", struck a chord in wartime America and the record became one of her biggest hits.\n\nHoliday continued to record for Decca until 1950, including sessions with the Duke Ellington and Count Basie orchestras, and two duets with Louis Armstrong. Holiday's Decca recordings featured big bands and, sometimes, strings, contrasting her intimate small group Columbia accompaniments. Some of the songs from her Decca repertoire became signatures, including \"Don't Explain\" and \"Good Morning Heartache\".\n\nHoliday made one major film appearance, opposite Louis Armstrong in New Orleans (1947). The musical drama featured Holiday singing with Armstrong and his band and was directed by Arthur Lubin. Holiday was not pleased that her role was that of a maid, as she recalled in her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues: \"I thought I was going to play myself in it. I thought I was going to be Billie Holiday doing a couple of songs in a nightclub setting and that would be that. I should have known better. When I saw the script, I did. You just tell one Negro girl who's made movies who didn't play a maid or a whore. I don't know any. I found out I was going to do a little singing, but I was still playing the part of a maid.\"\n\nOn May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for the possession of narcotics and drugs in her New York apartment. On May 27, 1947, she was in court. \"It was called 'The United States of America versus Billie Holiday'. And that's just the way it felt,\" Holiday recalled in her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues. Holiday pleaded guilty and was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. Holiday said she never \"sang a note\" at Alderson even though people wanted her to. Luckily for Holiday, she was released early (March 16, 1948) due to good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, everybody was there to welcome her back, including her pianist Bobby Tucker. \"I might just as well have wheeled into Penn Station and had a quiet little get-together with the Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service.\"\n\nEd Fishman (who fought with Joe Glaser to be Holiday's manager) thought of the idea to throw a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday hesitated at the idea because she thought that nobody would accept her back, but she decided to go with the idea.\n\nOn March 27, 1948, the Carnegie concert was a success. Everything was sold out before the concert started. It isn't certain how many sets Holiday did. She did sing Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" and \"Strange Fruit\". The concert was not recorded.\n\nAlthough childless, Billie Holiday had two godchildren: singer Billie Lorraine Feather, daughter of Leonard Feather, and Bevan Dufty, son of William Dufty.\n\nHoliday stated that she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married to Monroe, she became romantically involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer, eventually becoming his common law wife. She finally divorced Monroe in 1947, and also split with Guy. Because of her 1947 conviction, her New York City Cabaret Card was revoked which kept her from working in clubs there for the remaining 12 years of her life, except when she played at the Ebony Club in 1948, where she opened under the permission of John Levy.\nBy the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relations with abusive men led to deteriorating health. As evidenced by her later recordings, Holiday's voice coarsened and did not project the vibrance it once had. However, she retained — and, perhaps, strengthened — the emotional impact of her delivery (See below).\nOn March 28, 1952, Holiday married Louis McKay, a Mafia enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive, but he did try to get her off drugs. They were separated at the time of her death, but McKay had plans to start a chain of Billie Holiday vocal studios, a la Arthur Murray dance schools.\n\nHer late recordings on Verve constitute about a third of her commercial recorded legacy and are as well remembered as her earlier work for the Columbia, Commodore and Decca labels. In later years her voice became more fragile, but it never lost the edge that had always made it so distinctive. On November 10, 1956, she performed before a packed audience at Carnegie Hall, a major accomplishment for any artist, especially a black artist of the segregated period of American history. Her performance of \"Fine And Mellow\" on CBS's The Sound of Jazz program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend Lester Young; both were less than two years from death. (see the clip here)\n\nHoliday first toured Europe in 1954, as part of a Leonard Feather package that also included Buddy DeFranco and Red Norvo. When she returned, almost five years later, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's \"Chelsea at Nine\", in London. Her final studio recordings were made for MGM in 1959, with lush backing from Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on Columbia's Lady in Satin album the previous year — see below). The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later re-titled and re-released as Last Recordings.\n\nHoliday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, was ghostwritten by William Dufty and published in 1956. Dufty, a New York Post writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment, drawing on the work of earlier interviewers as well. His aim was to let Holiday tell her story her way.\n\nOn May 31, 1959, she was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying and her hospital room was raided by authorities.[12] Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959. In the final years of her life, she had been progressively swindled out of her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 (a tabloid fee) on her person.\n\nHer distinct delivery made Billie Holiday's performances instantly recognizable throughout her career. Her voice lacked range and was somewhat thin, plus years of abuse eventually altered the texture of her voice and gave it a prepossessing fragility. Nonetheless, the emotion with which she imbued each song remained not only intact but also profound.[13]. Her last major recording, a 1958 album entitled Lady in Satin, features the backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Ray Ellis, who said of the album in 1997: \"I would say that the most emotional moment was her listening to the playback of \"I'm a Fool to Want You.\" There were tears in her eyes ... After we finished the album I went into the control room and listened to all the takes. I must admit I was unhappy with her performance, but I was just listening musically instead of emotionally. It wasn't until I heard the final mix a few weeks later that I realized how great her performance really was\".\n\nIn 1972, Diana Ross portrayed her in the film Lady Sings the Blues, which is loosely based on the 1959 autobiography of the same name. The 1972 film earned Ross a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1987, Billie Holiday was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1994, the United States Postal Service introduced a Billie Holiday postage stamp, she ranked #6 on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Rock n' Roll in 1999, and she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Over the years, there have been many tributes to Billie Holiday, including \"The Day Lady Died\", a 1959 poem by Frank O'Hara, and \"Angel of Harlem\", a 1988 release by the group U2.\n\nSongs composed by Holiday\n\"Billie's Blues\" (1936) \n\"Don't Explain\" (1944) \n\"Everything Happens For The Best\" (1939) \n\"Fine and Mellow\" (1939) \n\"God Bless the Child\" (1941) \n\"Lady Sings the Blues\" (1956) \n\"Long Gone Blues\" (1939) \n\"Now or Never\" (1949) \n\"Our Love Is Different\" (1939) \n\"Stormy Blues\" (1954) \n\nDiscography\nHoliday recorded extensively for four labels: Columbia Records, issued on its subsidiary labels Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records, and OKeh Records, from 1933 through 1942, and the label proper in 1958; Commodore Records in 1939 and 1944; Decca Records from 1944 through 1950; and Verve Records, also on its earlier imprint Clef Records, from 1952 through 1958.

    "bioSummary": "Billie Holiday (Eleanora Fagan Gough, Philadelphia, PA, April 7, 1915 – New York City, NY, July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.\n\nNicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner Lester Young, Holiday was a highly original influence on jazz and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and intimate approach to singing. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

  "Billy Joel": {
    "bio": "Billy Joel (born William Martin Joel on May 9, 1949 in Bronx, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man,\" in 1973, Joel has become a multi-million-selling recording artist. Joel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1971 until he stopped recording pop/rock music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock (or even pop) artists to have Top 10 hits in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. \n\nJoel's induction into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America's leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.\n\nJoel first lived in the South Bronx, in New York City, but his family soon moved to Hicksville, Long Island. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring Levittown, NY (formed 1947). In truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, a town that has existed since 1648, near the Levittown border, in a section of town where Post-WW2, there were houses developed by Abe Levitt, known as Levitt Houses, thus forming nearby Levittown. His father, Howard Joel, was a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Germany, whose father Karl Amson Joel owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England, to an agnostic Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to Eastern Europe. His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. \n\nFrom an early age Joel had an intense interest in music; especially classical music. He began piano lessons at an early age, and his interest in music instead of sports was the source for much teasing and bullying in his early years. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.\n\nJoel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in 1967. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician's lifestyle.[citation needed] Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High's graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.\n\nAt the age of 14 Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer Shadow Morton, Joel was also the pianist on the Shangri-Las hit \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\". In 1966, he joined The Hassles, a Long Island band that had some local success (\"Every Step I Take,\" \"You Got Me Hummin'\"). The Hassles released two albums The Hassles (1967) and Hour of the Wolf (1968) on the United Artists record label. Following The Hassles' demise in 1969, he formed the progressive rock duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in July 1970 and disbanded the following October.\n\nUpon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe depression, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted suicide attempt. The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song \"Tomorrow Is Today.\" Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early 1971, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with Chubby Checker and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called Changes.\n\n*Cold Spring Harbor (1971)\nJoel signed his first solo record contract with Artie Ripp of Family Productions, and subsequently recorded his first solo album. Cold Spring Harbor (a reference to the Long Island town of the same name), was released in 1971. However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.\n\nIn order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to Los Angeles, California with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months of the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for \"Piano Man.\"\n\nIn addition, a Philadelphia radio station, WMMR-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, \"Captain Jack,\" which was taken from a live concert broadcast which became an underground hit on the East Coast. An Executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon, heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel's talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as \"She's Got a Way\" and \"Everybody Loves You Now\" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on Songs in the Attic. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. Cold Spring Harbor got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.\n\n*Piano Man (1973)\nHis experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp, with the condition that the \"Family Productions\" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song \"Piano Man.\" The album Piano Man was released in late 1973 and was certified Gold. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include \"Captain Jack,\" \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" and \"You're My Home\" (the b-side of the \"Piano Man\" single, which would later be covered by Helen Reddy), all of which would become staples of Joel's live shows.\n\n*Streetlife Serenade (1974)\nJoel remained in Los Angeles to write Streetlife Serenade, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both suburbia and the inner city pepper the album. The standout track on the album is \"The Entertainer,\" which picks up thematically where \"Piano Man\" left off. Joel was upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in \"The Entertainer,\" he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although Streetlife Serenade is considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it still contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its Debussy-like intro, \"Los Angelenos,\" and the instrumental \"The Mexican Connection.\"\n\n*Turnstiles (1976)\nDisenchanted with the LA music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, Turnstiles. On Turnstiles, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role. Songs were initially recorded and produced by famed Chicago producer James William Guercio, who subsequently was fired. The songs were re-recorded and Joel took over, producing the album himself. Joel's \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" was a minor hit, echoed the Phil Spector sound, and was even covered by Ronnie Spector. The album also featured the New York anthem, \"New York State of Mind,\" a bluesy, jazzy epic that has become one of Joel's signature songs and was later covered by fellow Columbia labelmate Barbra Streisand on her Streisand Superman album. Other top songs on the album include \"Summer, Highland Falls,\" and \"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\" Songs such as \"Prelude/Angry Young Man\" would become a mainstay of his concerts for years.\n\n*The Stranger (1977)\nFor his album The Stranger, Columbia Records united Joel with producer Phil Ramone. The album yielded four Top 40 hits on the Billboard Charts in the US. Album sales exceeded Columbia's previous top album, Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, and was certified multi-platinum. It was Joel's first Top Ten album, as it rose to # 2 on the charts. Phil Ramone eventually produced every Billy Joel studio release until 1989's Storm Front. The Stranger netted Joel Grammy nominations, for Album of the Year and Song of the Year, for \"Just the Way You Are\", which was written as a gift to his wife Elizabeth and became his highest charting song to date in the United States.\n\nIn 2007 \"The Stranger\" was re-released with a bonus disk of a live concert recorded at Carnegie Hall June 3, 1977 that featured mostly songs from his first three albums. One can only guess that the success of \"The Stranger\" and \"52nd Street\" made this live album a bit obsolete for release at the time.\n\n*52nd Street (1978)\nJoel faced high expectations on his next album. 52nd Street was conceived as a day in Manhattan, and was named after the block where Columbia Records' office was located. Fans purchased over seven million copies on the strength of the hits \"My Life\", \"Big Shot,\" and \"Honesty.\" This helped 52nd Street become Joel's first # 1 album. \"My Life\" eventually became the theme song for a new US television sitcom, Bosom Buddies, which featured actor Tom Hanks in one of his earliest roles. 52nd Street was the first album to be released on Compact Disc in Japan (1982). The album won Grammys for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male & Album of the Year. Despite all the cover art for the album showing Joel holding a trumpet, he doesn't play the instrument on the album. The trumpet is only played on one track, \"Zanzibar\", by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.\n\n*Glass Houses (1980)\nJoel in a promotional picture for Glass Houses.The success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Honesty\" never sat well with him. With Glass Houses, Joel attacked the new wave popularity with aplomb. This album yielded such classics as \"You May Be Right\" (# 7, May 1980), \"Close To The Borderline\"(flipside of the \"You May Be Right\" single), \"Don't Ask Me Why\" (# 19, September 1980), \"Sometimes A Fantasy\" (# 36, November 1980) and \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me,\" which became Joel's first Billboard # 1 song in July, 1980. Glass Houses won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It would also win the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category.\n\n*Songs In The Attic (1981)\nHis next release, Songs In The Attic, was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. Songs In The Attic was recorded during arena and club shows in June and July of 1980. This release introduced many fans, who just discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.\n\n*The Nylon Curtain (1982)\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. Considered his most audacious and ambitious album, Joel took more than a page or two from the Lennon-McCartney songwriting style on this heavily Beatles-influenced album.\nWork began on The Nylon Curtain in the spring of 1982. However, Joel was sidelined when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. The driver ran a red light and collided with Joel, who was on his motorcycle. His left wrist was broken and his hand badly damaged. Due to surgery, which included the temporary insertion of five pins into his wrist, and a month in the hospital, production of the album was shut down temporarily while Joel recovered. In the meantime, Joel's first video special, Live from Long Island, was recorded at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on December 30, 1982. The Nylon Curtain went to # 7 on the charts, supported by the popular singles \"Allentown\", Goodnight Saigon, and Pressure. Allentown rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982 and the most successful song from The Nylon Curtain album. The album is considered by many of his fans to be the masterpiece of his works. Joel's marriage began to suffer as his success rose, and Joel and wife Elizabeth divorced. In accordance with the divorce agreement, Elizabeth took half of the singer's assets. Following his tour supporting The Nylon Curtain, Joel retreated to the island of St. Bart's for rest and relaxation. At the hotel's bar, he met supermodel Christie Brinkley, who had been divorced from her husband Jean-François Allaux. They eventually became a couple, and married on March 23, 1985.\n\n*An Innocent Man (1983) \nJoel in a promotional picture for An Innocent Man.The song \"Uptown Girl\" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation. \"Uptown Girl\" was conceived as Joel wondered aloud how the gorgeous Christie Brinkley could wind up with a guy like him. It became a worldwide hit upon its release, and Joel's sole # 1 in the United Kingdom. The resulting album, An Innocent Man, was compiled as a tribute to the doo-wop music of the 1950s, and also resulted in Joel's second Billboard # 1 hit, \"Tell Her About It.\" The album, which reached # 4 on the charts, boasted 6 top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but ultimately lost to Michael Jackson's Thriller.\n\n*Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 (1985)\nFollowing the success of An Innocent Man, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time, he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs \"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\" and \"The Night Is Still Young\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album. Greatest Hits was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after The Wall by Pink Floyd). It has since been certified diamond by the RIAA for 10.5 million albums sold (21 million disks). To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a 2-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man,\" for this project. Two versions of Greatest Hits were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:\n\nWhile all the longer hits (\"Piano Man,\" \"Captain Jack,\" \"Goodnight Saigon\") are fully intact, many other shorter songs (\"Pressure,\" \"Just The Way You Are,\" \"My Life\") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release. The 1985 release features the live version of \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" from Songs in the Attic. The version from Turnstiles was used for the 1998 re-release. \nThe 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years. \n\n*The Bridge (1986)\nJoel had already scored a hit with \"Modern Woman\" from the 1985 movie, \"Ruthless People,\" (starring Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold), when he began work on the album that would become The Bridge in early 1986. Ray Charles contributed vocals and music to the song \"Baby Grand\" with Joel, and Steve Winwood played Hammond organ on the song \"Getting Closer.\" The final song recorded for the album was \"Code Of Silence.\" Cyndi Lauper appears on the album, contributing backing vocals. Though it broke into the Top Ten, The Bridge was not a success in relation to some of Joel's other albums, but it yielded the hit \"A Matter Of Trust.\" In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a Les Paul-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad \"This Is The Time\" also charted, and has been a favorite on the prom circuit ever since. \"Modern Woman\" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn't care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be My Lives). It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the \"Family Productions\" logo.\n\nAt around this time, Billy completed voice work on Disney's Oliver & Company, released in 1988. A loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, Billy brought both his acting and musical talents to the film as Dodger. For the film, Billy recorded a song titled \"Why Should I Worry?\" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy's acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of Disney cartoons as a child.\n\nThroughout his tour supporting The Bridge, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. He would be the first American rock act to play there since the Berlin Wall went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.\n\nThe audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the Communist Party, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. \n\n*КОНЦЕРТ (1987)\nThe album КОНЦЕРТ, Russian for \"Concert,\" was released in the fall of 1987. Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man.\" It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.\n\n* Storm Front (1989)\nThe song \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" the first single from the album Storm Front, was released in September 1989. The song became Joel's third US Number 1 hit. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first Number 1 album since Glass Houses, 9 years earlier. Storm Front was Joel's first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner fame. Joel also brought in some fresh faces to join the band, including talented multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero, who would go on to become Joel's musical director and architect of his live sound. After \"We Didn't Start The Fire,\" Storm Front also produced the hit \"I Go To Extremes.\" The album was also notable for its song \"Leningrad,\" written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and \"The Downeaster Alexa,\" written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad \"And So It Goes.\"\n\nIn 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth's brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered. The case later settled out of court. \n\n*River of Dreams (1993)\nJoel started work on River of Dreams in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date. The album includes hits such as \"The River of Dreams\", \"All About Soul\", \"The Great Wall of China\", and \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on \"The Essential Billy Joel\" (2001).\n\nIn August 1995, Billy Joel's long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his Long Island home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel's albums from Turnstiles through The Bridge.\n\nIn 1999 Joel performed at New York's Madison Square Garden on the eve of the new millennium which at the time was considered to be Joel's last solo concert, The concert (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert\n\nIn 2001 Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by Richard Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances. The album topped the classical charts at # 1. On September 21, 2001, Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert.\n\nJoel has toured extensively with Elton John on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours. During these shows, the two have played each other's songs and performed duets.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, B-tracks, and live/alternate versions to hit songs. The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\", \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Keepin' The Faith\", and live versions of \"I Go To Extremes\" and \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.\n\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the United States. Having not written any new songs, he featured a sampling of all his songs in his career, including his major hits. His tour includes an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Joel released \"12 Gardens: Live\", a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during his 2006 tour.\n\nThe singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, when he played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena.\n\nThe record has consequently earned Joel the only retired number in the arena owned by a non-athlete. The retired number, which was 12, hangs in the rafters along with many others such as hockey great Mark Messier.\n\n2006 also saw Billy Joel visit the United Kingdom and Ireland (as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour) for the first time in many years, playing to capacity crowds in Birmingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester, Glasgow, London and Dublin.\n\nOn July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, Italy with the Colosseum as the backdrop, and performed classic hits for hundreds of thousands of fans. Joel performed favorites such as \"New York State of Mind,\" \"Honesty,\" and \"Just the Way You Are.\"\n\nWhile introducing one song, the 57-year-old singer joked in shaky Italian, \"This song is as old as the Colosseum.\"\n\nOrganizers estimated 500,000 people turned out for the show. The concert was opened by Canadian pop-rocker and songwriter Bryan Adams.\n\nBilly Joel will tour South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006.\n\nJoel's lyrics have made many references to locations in the New York City metropolitan area, particularly Long Island. For example, the \"Miracle Mile\" line in 1980's \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" refers to the affluent shopping district located on Northern Boulevard in the community of Manhasset and 1980's \"You May Be Right\" references walking through the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn alone as proof of craziness. In his 1973 song \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" he describes a certain \"Billy\" as being from the town of Oyster Bay, the municipality in which the hamlet of Hicksville is located. He has since stated, in the liner notes from his album Songs in the Attic, that this \"Billy\" is not himself, but rather an Oyster Bay bartender.\n\nSeveral of Joel's songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including \"Piano Man,\" which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a Los Angeles piano bar in the early 1970s, and \"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,\" purportedly written about either the Syosset mainstay Christiano's or a similar eatery in New York City's Little Italy. His song \"Vienna\" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while \"Big Shot\" was based on a bad date with Mick Jagger's ex-wife Bianca.\n\nIn a Playboy interview, Joel indicated that \"Rosalinda's Eyes\" was penned for his mother, Rosalinda, as the song his father should have written for her.\n\n\"Only The Good Die Young\" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in St. Louis, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that \"the point of the song wasn't so much anti-Catholic as [it was] pro-lust\".\n\nHis music reflects influences from many different genres including European classical composers, Aaron Copland, 1950s doo wop, Broadway/Tin Pan Alley, jazz, blues, punk, ska, gospel, pop, and even Russian folk songs, to straight-up rock & roll. This has, in part, led to his broad success over a long period of time, but made him difficult to categorize in popular music today.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel's band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:\n\nBilly Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica \nLiberty DeVitto — drums, percussion \nDoug Stegmeyer — bass guitar, backing vocals \nRussell Javors — rhythm guitars, backing vocals \nDavid Brown — lead guitars \nRichie Cannata — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals \nThis was also the lineup for Joel's first live album, Songs In The Attic.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw significant changes to Joel's band. By the River of Dreams tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and Mark Rivera joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song \"New York State of Mind\" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Rivera for the Greatest Hits version of the song). The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin' Out musical. For the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel's musical 'Movin' Out') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the \"New York State Of Mind\" solo.\n\n\nDespite having never graduated from high school, Joel has been presented with multiple honorary doctorates:\n\nHonorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Syracuse University\nDoctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University (1991) \nDoctor from Berklee College of Music (1993) \nDoctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University (1997) \nDoctor of Music from Southampton College (2000) \nDoctor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University (2006)[8] \n\nJoel was also named MusiCares Person of the Year for 2002, an award given each year at the same time as the Grammy Awards. At the dinner honoring Joel, various artists performed versions of his songs including Nelly Furtado, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Diana Krall, Rob Thomas, and Natalie Cole. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.\n\nIn 2004, Joel married 23 year-old Katie Lee. Lee is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the time of the wedding, Joel was 54. Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray, 18, served as maid of honor. Joel's second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. Lee works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show, George Hirsch: Living it Up!. In 2006, Katie Lee hosted Bravo's Top Chef.\n\nIn 2002 he crashed his car in East Hampton, New York, and soon after entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 2003 Joel crashed his car into a tree in eastern Long Island, and was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. In April 2004, Joel crashed his car into a house on Long Island. In March 2005 Joel checked into a Betty Ford rehabilitation center[12], where he spent 30 days. \n\nMovin' Out (2002), is a musical based on twenty-four Billy Joel songs which was a smash hit on Broadway from 2002 to 2005 (last Broadway show was on December 11, 2005). Joel was composer, lyricist, and orchestrator; Tony Award for Best Orchestrations. The musical is really a dance performance choreographed by famed choreographer Twyla Tharp, with Joel's songs sung by Michael Cavanaugh. \n\nIn 2014, he started a series of concerts at New York City's Madison Square Garden, and vowed to perform monthly as long as demand continued.  He sold out 73 consecutive shows through February 2020, before the record-setting series went on hiatus due to the pandemic.\n\nhttp://www.billyjoel.com User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bob B. Soxx and The Blue Jeans": {
    "bio": "Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans was an early 1960s vocal group produced by Phil Spector, and was initially conceived as a vehicle for the lead vocals of Bobby Sheen, who took the stage name Bob B. Soxx. \"The Blue Jeans\" were backing vocalists, Darlene Love and Fanita James, both of whom were also members of girl group The Blossoms.\n\nDespite Sheen's status as group leader, by the time the trio entered the recording studio, Spector was often using Darlene Love as the group's primary vocalist. Sheen sang lead on the group's first hit: 1962's \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" (originally from the 1946 Disney movie Song of the South). Love, meanwhile, handled the lead vocals on Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans' two follow-up singles: 1963's \"Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Hearts?\" and \"Not Too Young to Get Married\".\n\nSheen and Love share vocal duties on the only album the group ever recorded (1963's Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah).\n\nSheen can be heard as lead vocalist on the group's final recordings, two cuts on the classic Spector-produced LP \"A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector\" (1963), on which Love also appears as a solo artist. On the cover of this album, a group portrait shows Sheen with two \"Blue Jeans\" vocalists who have been tentatively identified as James and yet another Blossoms member, Gloria Jones.\n\nAfter 1963 the group was dropped by Philles Records and effectively ceased to exist. Sheen went back to using his real name, cut some tracks for Capitol Records in the mid 1960s, and later joined a late-running touring version of The Coasters. Love, meanwhile, recorded a few solo hits, but, more memorably was the lead vocalist on at least two hit records by The Crystals.

  "Bob Dylan": {
    "bio": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States)  is an American singer-songwriter. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years.\nDylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. \n\nMuch of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.\n\nHis album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\", released in July of 1965, later being named \"The Greatest Song of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan's backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1974, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered Christ, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn't play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.\n\nDylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1980-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performances have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.\n\nBob Dylan's strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.\n\nDylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  \n\nNobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Here is the speech written by Dylan, although unable to attend:\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/arts/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech.html?_r=0 User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bob Marley": {
    "bio": "Bob Marley (February 6, 1945 – May 11, 1981), born Nesta Robert Marley which was later to be changed by passport officials to Robert Nesta Marley, was a Jamaican singer-songwriter, guitarist, and activist. He was the most widely known writer and performer of Reggae, and more specifically Roots Reggae.  He is famous for popularising the genre outside of Jamaica and the Caribbean. Much of his music dealt with the struggles of the spiritually wealthy rasta and/or spiritually powerful Jah Rastafari.\n\nStarting out in 1963 with the group Bob Marley & The Wailers, he forged a distinctive song-writing and vocal style that would later resonate with audiences worldwide.\n\nThe Wailers would go on to release some of the earliest reggae records with producer Lee Scratch Perry. \n\nAfter The Wailers disbanded in 1974, Marley pursued a solo career which culminated in the release of the album Exodus in 1977 which established his worldwide reputation and became one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, with sales of more than 75 million albums and singles.\n\nBob Marley was a member of this Rastafari movement, whose culture was a key element in the development of reggae. Bob Marley became the leading proponent of the Rastafari, taking their music out of socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene.\n\nNow considered a \"Rasta\" prophet, Marley's adoption of the characteristic Rastafarian dreadlocks and famous use of marijuana as a sacred sacrament in the late sixties were an integral part of his persona. He is said to have entered every performance proclaiming the divinity of Jah Rastafari.\n   \nA few months before his death, Marley was baptised into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and took the name Berhane Selassie (meaning the Light of the Holy Trinity in Amharic).\n\nHis best known songs are a mixture of reggae, Roots Reggae, and rhythm and blues, which include:\n\nI Shot the Sheriff\nExodus\nCould You Be Loved\nRedemption Song\nNo Woman, No Cry\nThree Little Birds\nBuffalo Soldier\nIs This Love\nOne Love\nStir It Up\nJammin'\nGet Up, Stand Up\n\nHis posthumous album Legend (1984) became the best-selling reggae album ever, with sales of more than 12 million copies.\n\nBob Marley was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994; in December 1999, his album “Exodus” (1977) was named Album of the Century by Time Magazine and his song “One Love” was designated Song of the Millennium by the BBC. \n\n\nAwards and Honors:\n\n1976 - Rolling Stone Magazine's \"Band of the Year\"\n1978 - United Nations' Peace Medal of the Third World\n1981 - Jamaican Order of Merit\n1994 - The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame\n1999 - Time Magazine's Best Album of the Century\n2001 - Star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n2001- GRAMMY Lifetime Achievement Award\n2004 - Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time (#11)\n2006 - The United Kingdom's \"Blue Plaque\"\n2006 - Bob Marley Boulevard named in Brooklyn, New York\n2010 - GRAMMY Hall Of Fame (Catch A Fire)\n2012 - August the 7th, proclamed Bob Marley Day (Los Angeles)\n2013 - GRAMMY Tribute Performance\n\n\n\nMarley tragically died of cancer at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami, Florida on May 11, 1981.\n\nReligion:\nBob Marley was a member of the Rastafari movement, (not rastafaranism as that is seen as a derogortory term as Rasta's don't like being refered to as an ism) whose culture was a key element in the development of reggae music in Jamaica. Rastas belive they are outcast from their native Zion and looked on Ethiopia as their real home and Tafarai Makonnen, who took the title Haile Sellasie I(Power of the Holy Trinity in Amharic), after he became the emperor of Ethiopia, as their leader. Rastas belive H.I.M. is Jesus in flesh. Rastas are considered to be black Jews. \nRastas claim their root from King Solomon and Abbysinian queen of Sheba, through lineage of their son Menelik, emperor of Abbysinia. H.I.M. is said to be a direct decendant of Menelik. 'Ras' means Head and 'Tafarai\" means Creator. 'Jah' is the shortened form of the Hebrew word Jehovah. Rastas belive in one truth and that is the truth of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Sellasie I, King of kings, Lord of lords, conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah, two hundred and twenty-fifth ruler of the three thousand year old Ethiopian empire, elect of Jah, Light of the world. Jah Rastafari live out. Rastas preach a non-materialistic, egalitarian way of life. Bob Marley became a leading proponent of the Rastafari, taking their music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene. Bob Marley was baptized by the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian Church in Kingston, Jamaica on November 4, 1980. \n\nDiet:\nMarley's diet was ital; fruit, vegetables and fish; which is food approved by the Rastafari movement. \n\nFamily:\nBob Marley had 13 children: three with his wife Rita Marley, two adopted from Rita's previous relationships, and the remaining eight with separate women. \n\nHis children are, in order of birth:\nImani Carole, born May 22, 1963, to Cheryl Murray; \nSharon, born November 23, 1964, to Rita in previous relationship; \nCedella born August 23, 1967, to Rita; \nDavid \"Ziggy Marley\", born October 17, 1968, to Rita; \nStephen Marley, born April 20, 1972, to Rita; \nRobert \"Robbie\", born May 16, 1972, to Pat Williams; \nRohan, born May 19, 1972, to Janet Hunt; \nKaren, born 1973 to Janet Bowen; \nStephanie, born August 17, 1974; according to Cedella Booker she was the daughter of Rita and a man called Ital with whom Rita had an affair; nonetheless she was acknowledged as Bob's daughter; \nJulian Marley, born June 4, 1975, to Lucy Pounder; \nKy-Mani Marley, born February 26, 1976, to Anita Belnavis; \nDamian Marley, born July 21, 1978, to Cindy Breakspeare; \nMakeda, born May 30, 1981, to Yvette Crichton. \n\n\nSee here for comedian Bob Marley the comedian:  Comedian Bob Marley User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bob Schneider": {
    "bio": "Bob Schneider (born October 12, 1965) is an American musician based in Austin, TX. He is the former lead-singer of Ugly Americans.\n\nFor nearly ten years, Schneider has performed a Monday night residency at the Saxon Pub, an intimate and legendary venue on South Lamar, Austin, Texas. Schneider and the members of Lonelyland, the band name that he uses to keep these shows “underground,” are seated on stage as they work through a “live rehearsal” of songs that Schneider calls up from his repertoire of over four hundred songs.\n\nThere are always new songs that are played for the first time or new\narrangements of classics that are tested. The show often begins with acoustic, somber and introspective songs and eventually gives way to storytelling, raunchy rock and comedic breaks. \n\nBut anything goes…really. And, that is exactly what the audience loves about Schneider. \n\nSchneider's recording career spans some 20 albums, which include eight solo albums and those with his bands, all of which are legendary in the Austin, Texas music scene of the 90’s, The Scabs, Joe Rockhead and The Ugly Americans. There are many peaks within these albums but Lonelyland (2001) and I’m Good Now (2004) stand out at as the “mainstream highlights” while The Galaxy Kings (2002) and Underneath the Onion Trees (2000), are beautiful “artistic statements” and fan favorites.\n\nIf you take a journey through this collection of albums you’ll discover an artist with no boundaries. Schneider's repertoire covers a spectrum of musical styles…. mambo, rap, blues, country, Latin, swing, soul, even bluegrass…. all done with the aplomb of a virtuoso of any one of those musical genres.\n\nMany of these genres are explored on Schneider’s album, Tarantula. Tarantula sparkles with songs that reflect a songwriter, artist and entertainer at the peak of his creative heights. It is an apex in Schneider's album catalog and stands alongside Lonelyland and I’m Good Now as one of his best.\n\nFans will know “['track artist=Bob Schneider]Tarantula” as the name of the song that has been Schneider's live signature for years. It’s the part of the show where the audience jumps to their feet, dances in the aisles, howls at the moon and sings the refrain along with Schneider. Sheer fun.\n\nThe song has never been available on a studio album so fans will know right away that they are in for a treat. Those lucky enough to have been at the Saxon the night that the lead single, “40 Dogs (Like Romeo and Juliet)” was debuted knew right away that they were in for something special with this album. There is a beautiful heart-rendering break-up song, “Changing Your Mind,” with Patty Griffin lending even more rue. “Trash” and “Bicycle Vs. The Car” both prove again that Bob is a master of pop hooks, melody and inspired wordplay.\n\nBob Schneider: At A Glance\n\nHe was born in Michigan but moved to Germany when he was two where he grew up attending Catholic school. His father sang opera and his mother taught school. He left Germany as a student to attend art school at the University of Texas/El Paso. He dropped out and moved to Austin where he struggled around as a musician before gaining some national recognition via his punk-funk band Joe Rockhead. He signed to Capricorn Records as the rock n’soul band, Ugly Americans, and nearly simultaneously formed The Scabs with a band of infamous Austin neo-legends known for (and still performing) their outrageous live shows.\n\nIn 1999, Bob took a solo turn to explore his introspective singer/songwriter side, and in 2001, Republic Records signs him after Lonelyland, explodes in his hometown and becomes (and remains) the biggest selling album in the history of Austin’s infamous Waterloo Records. A couple of self-released “artistic exploration” albums are released before, I’m Good Now, is released on Vanguard in 2004, and there is another flirt with mainstream chart success with the singles, “Captain Kirk” and “Come With Me Tonight.”\n\nHe has built his audience by touring relentlessly and over the years has opened for the Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow, Dave Matthews and the H.O.R.D.E Tour, but mostly through headlining club and theater tours. Bob will be on tour in May and June of 2009 playing songs from the new album, Tarantula. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bob Weir": {
    "bio": "Robert Hall Weir (October 16, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter best known as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the group disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog, and Furthur, which he co-led with former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer, bassist Oteil Burbridge, and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti to form the band Dead & Company.\n\nDuring his career with the Grateful Dead, Weir played mostly rhythm guitar and sang many of the band's rock & roll and country & western songs. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.\n\nEarly life\nWeir was born in San Francisco, California, to John (Jack) Parber (1925–2015), of Italian and German ancestry, and a fellow college student, Phyllis Inskeep (1924–1997), of German, Irish, and English ancestry, who later gave him up for adoption; he was raised by his adoptive parents, Frederic Utter Weir and Eleanor (née Cramer) Weir, in Atherton. He began playing guitar at age thirteen after less successful experimentation with the piano and the trumpet. He had trouble in school because of undiagnosed dyslexia and he was expelled from nearly every school he attended, including Menlo School in Atherton and Fountain Valley School in Colorado, where he met future Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1963, 16-year-old Weir and an underage friend were wandering the back alleys of Palo Alto, looking for a club that would admit them, when they heard banjo music. They followed the music to its source, Dana Morgan's Music Store. They encountered a 21-year-old Jerry Garcia, oblivious to the date, waiting for his students to arrive. Weir and Garcia spent the night playing music together and then decided to form a band. The Beatles significantly influenced their musical direction. \"The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band,\" said Bob Weir. \"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\" Originally called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, the band was later renamed The Warlocks and eventually the Grateful Dead.\n\nWeir played rhythm guitar and sang a large portion of the lead vocals through all of the Dead's 30-year career. In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan. These shows, with the band billed as \"Mickey and the Hartbeats\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. In his biography of Jerry Garcia, Blair Jackson notes, \"Garcia and Lesh determined that Weir and Pigpen were not pulling their weight musically in the band... Most of the band fights at this time were about Bobby's guitar playing.\" Late in the year, the band relented and took Weir and Pigpen back in full-time.\n\nThe incident apparently led to a period of significant growth in Weir's guitar playing. Phil Lesh said that when drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in early 1971, he was able to hear Weir's playing more clearly than ever and \"I found myself astonished, delighted and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing.\" Lesh described Weir's playing as \"quirky, whimsical and goofy\" and noted his ability to play chord voicings on the guitar (with only four fingers) that one would normally hear from a keyboard (with up to ten fingers).\n\nIn the late 1970s, Weir began to experiment with slide guitar techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and he has cited artists as diverse as John Coltrane, the Rev. Gary Davis, and Igor Stravinsky as influences.\n\nWeir's first solo album Ace appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were Keith Godchaux and his wife Donna, both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album's release. A live version of the album's best-known song, \"Playing in the Band\", had been issued on the Skull & Roses album of the previous year. While continuing to perform as a member of the Grateful Dead, in 1975 and 1976 Weir played in the Bay Area band Kingfish with friends Matt Kelly and Dave Torbert. He later contributed to Kelly's 1987 album A Wing and a Prayer, on Relix Records. In 1978 he fronted the Bob Weir Band with Brent Mydland, who joined the Grateful Dead the following year. In 1980 he formed another side band, Bobby and the Midnites.\n\nShortly before Garcia's death in 1995, Weir formed another band, RatDog Revue, later shortened to RatDog. In RatDog, Weir performs covers of songs by various artists, including The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, and Willie Dixon while also performing many Grateful Dead songs. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album Evening Moods.\n\nWeir has participated in the various reformations of the Grateful Dead's members, including 1998, 2000, and 2002 stints as The Other Ones and in 2003, 2004 and 2009 as The Dead. In 2008 he performed in the two Deadheads for Obama concerts. In 2009 Bob Weir and Phil Lesh formed a new band called Furthur—so-named in honor of Ken Kesey's famous psychedelically painted bus.\n\nIn 2011, Weir founded the Tamalpais Research Institute, also known as TRI Studios. TRI is a high-tech recording studio and virtual music venue, used to stream live concerts over the internet in high-definition.\n\nIn 2012, Weir toured with Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes and singer/songwriter Jackie Greene as the Weir, Robinson, & Greene Acoustic Trio.\n\nWeir resuscitated RatDog in March 2013. The RatDog Quartet, featuring Weir, Jay Lane, Robin Sylvester, and Jonathan Wilson debuted on March 3, at the Sweetwater Music Hall. Jason Crosby was their featured guest at the first two shows.\n\nOn April 25, 2013, Weir collapsed onstage during a Furthur performance at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York. The band finished the show without him. He performed with the band two days later in Atlantic City, but on April 29 a representative announced that Weir would be \"unable to perform in any capacity for the next several weeks\" for unspecified reasons. Weir resumed performing that summer.\n\nOn April 23, 2014, The Other One: The Long Strange Trip of Bob Weir premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival directed by Mike Fleiss husband of Miss America 2012, Laura Kaeppeler.\n\nOn August 10, 2014, Weir abruptly canceled all of his upcoming appearances, according to The Huffington Post, \"The cancellations include all shows for the rest of the year with his band Ratdog, as well as a concert with Furthur\". According to Jambase, Ratdog performed without Weir in Las Vegas in July 2014. \"A statement from the venue said Weir was 'under the weather'.\"\n\nIn early July 2015, Weir joined the other original living members of the Grateful Dead —Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, and Phil Lesh — for three shows at Soldier Field in Chicago. These four surviving members (known as the \"Core Four\") were joined by Jeff Chimenti on keys and Phish's Trey Anastasio on lead guitar and shared vocals, and Bruce Hornsby on piano. The reunion was 20 years nearly to the day since the band's final concert with Jerry Garcia at the same venue in 1995. \"Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of Grateful Dead\" was billed as the original four members' last performance together. Based on demand, two additional Fare Thee Well concerts were added to the series, performed in late June 2015 at Levi Stadium in California.\n\nOn October 5, 2015, Weir performed with Ratdog at a special celebratory 60th Birthday Bash for Steve Kimock. It was the first time Ratdog had performed again since the aforementioned cancellations of his 2014 summer tour.\n\nIn late 2015 Weir teamed up with former Grateful Dead bandmates Mickey Hart and Billy Kreutzmann as well as guitarist John Mayer, bassist Oteil Burbridge and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti to form Dead & Company. They played 22 shows starting at the end of October, concluding with a four show New Year's run including two shows in San Francisco and two in Los Angeles, ending with a three set show on New Year's Eve. The band concluded its final tour on July 16, 2023, at Oracle Park in San Francisco. On January 31, 2024 the band announced a residency at Sphere in Las Vegas, Nevada, to begin in May 2024. While eighteen shows were announced initially, the residency was extended to thirty shows, ending in August 2024.\n\nIn May 2016, Weir was a guest speaker and performer for the second annual Einstein Gala, in Toronto, Canada, an event honoring the legacy of Albert Einstein and new visionaries in the arts and sciences. Weir spoke about what science and innovation had meant to him. Weir performed a solo acoustic set, and was joined mid-set by guitarist Dan Kanter. In the same month, Weir also confirmed, in an interview with The Guardian, that he was writing a book.\n\nIn 2016, a live recording of Weir performing with The National was included on the massive Day of the Dead. Weir's 2012 collaboration with members of The National as part of The Bridge Session helped pave the way for the Grateful Dead tribute.\n\nIn June 2016, at the Bonnaroo Arts And Music Festival, Weir received the first ever Les Paul Spirit Award, from the Les Paul Foundation. \"I cannot think of anyone more fitting to be honored with the first annual Les Paul Spirit Award than Bob Weir. Not only is he an extraordinary talent who has given us an amazing array of legendary music, but he is an innovator who understands music, technologies and the spirit of Les Paul,\" said Michael Braunstein, executive director of the Les Paul Foundation. \"If Les were still alive today, I have absolutely no doubt that he and Bob would be experimenting together at TRI Studios or at Les's house and the results would be extraordinary.\"\n\nWeir received the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 Americana Honors & Awards in Nashville, TN.\n\nIn September 2016, Weir released a new album of \"cowboy songs\" titled Blue Mountain. The release was followed by a tour beginning in October 2016. The album was inspired by his time working as a ranch hand in Wyoming, when he was fifteen years old.\n\nDuring the spring of 2018, Weir performed a series of concerts with former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. The duo, with guest musicians, was billed as Bobby and Phil.\n\nIn 2018 Weir formed a band called Wolf Bros. Billed as Bob Weir & Wolf Bros, the group initially was a trio, with Weir on guitar and vocals, Don Was on upright bass, and Jay Lane on drums. They toured the U.S. in the fall of 2018, the spring of 2019, and in early 2020. In late 2020 and early 2021 the band played several concerts at TRI Studios with Jeff Chimenti on keyboards and Greg Leisz on pedal steel guitar. After the first of these shows the band also added a horn and string section called the Wolfpack, comprising Brian Switzer on trumpet, Adam Theis on trombone, Sheldon Brown on saxophone, clarinet, and flute, Mads Tolling on violin, and Alex Kelly on cello. In the summer of 2021 this larger ensemble, now billed as Bobby Weir & Wolf Bros, played several concerts in Colorado and California.\n\nPersonal life\nWeir remained single throughout his years with the Grateful Dead, although he lived for several years (1969–1975) with Frankie Hart. Hart had been a go-go dancer at the Peppermint Lounge in New York, had worked in Apple Records American marketing department, for Apple Records in London, and had performed on the TV shows Hullabaloo and Shindig!. She was allegedly the inspiration for the Robert Hunter-Bob Weir song \"Sugar Magnolia\". Weir made her acquaintance through Mickey Hart, who dated her briefly. He met her following her first Grateful Dead show in New York in 1968. Her real name at that time was Frankie Azzara (from a previous marriage), but used the stage name \"Frankie Hart\" (after apparently \"borrowing\" Hart's last name). Although she and Weir never married, she adopted his last name after moving in with him and was subsequently known as Frankie Weir.\n\nOn July 15, 1999, Weir married Natascha Münter in Mill Valley, California. Together they have two daughters, Shala Monet Weir and Chloe Kaelia Weir. Bob Weir's sister-in law is Leilani Münter, a former race car driver in the ARCA Racing Series circuit. Weir is a long term vegetarian and advocate for animal rights who was influential in the founding of Farm Sanctuary.\n\nWeir is on the board of directors of the Rex Foundation, the Furthur Foundation, and HeadCount. He also is a member of the advisory board of the Jerry Garcia Foundation along with Peter Shapiro and Seth Rogin. He is an honorary member of the board of directors of the environmental organization Rainforest Action Network, along with Woody Harrelson, Bonnie Raitt, and John Densmore. He is also on the honorary board of directors of Little Kids Rock, a non-profit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in under-served public schools throughout the U.S.\n\nGuitars\nEarly pictures of The Warlocks in concert show him playing a Gretsch Duo-Jet, and after the Warlocks became the Grateful Dead, Weir briefly played a Rickenbacker 365, a Guild Starfire IV semi-hollowbody (with Garcia playing an identical cherry red Starfire IV, which appears very similar to the Gibson ES-335) as well as a Fender Telecaster before settling on a cherry red 1965 Gibson ES-335 as his primary guitar for the following decade. Weir can also be seen playing a sunburst ES-335 in The Grateful Dead Movie, filmed in October 1974. During the early 1970s, Weir also used a Gibson ES-345, a 1961 or 1962 Gibson SG and a black Gibson Les Paul of indeterminate age in 1971.\n\nIn 1974, Weir began working with Jeff Hasselberger at Ibanez to develop a custom instrument. Weir began playing the Ibanez 2681 during the recording of Blues for Allah; this was a testbed instrument with sliding pickups that Hasselberger used to develop several additional 2681s for use onstage, as well as Weir's custom \"Cowboy Fancy\" guitar, which he played from 1976 until the mid-1980s. Weir began using a Modulus Blackknife at that point, and continued to play the Blackknife, along with a hybrid Modulus/Casio guitar for the \"Space\" segment of Grateful Dead concerts for the rest of that band's history. Weir's acoustic guitars include several Martins, a Guild, an Ovation, and a line of Alvarez-Yairi signature models.\n\nWith his post-Grateful Dead bands, Weir has played a Modulus G3FH custom, a Gibson ES-335, and a 1956 Fender Telecaster previously owned by James Louis Parber, his late half-brother.\n\nIn August 2016, during a preview of Weir's solo album, Blue Mountain, Weir stated that the only instrument he used during the recording of the album was a Martin acoustic guitar.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Weir has collaborated with New York-based D'Angelico Guitars to produce several signature model instruments. The Premier, a semi-hollow guitar, was released in 2017, and the Deluxe Bedford, a solid-body, was released in 2020.

  "Bobbi Gentry": {
    "bio": "Bobbie Gentry (born July 27, 1942) is an American singer-songwriter. She was born Roberta Lee Streeter to Portuguese parents in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. She shot to international fame in the summer of 1967 with the quirky and intriguing Ode to Billie Joe, written by Gentry and sung in her warm, captivating style. \"Ode\" was listed as the most popular single of the year in many U.S. record surveys and was admired by Frank Sinatra and other singers.\n\nEarly years\n\nGentry spent her childhood living with her father in Greenwood, Mississippi, where she attended elementary school and began teaching herself to play the guitar, the bass guitar, and the banjo. In her early teens, she moved to Palm Springs, California, to live with her mother, Ruby Bullington Streeter, graduating from Palm Springs High School in 1962. It was during this time that the teenage Roberta settled on the stage name \"Bobbie Gentry,\" and began performing at local country clubs, encouraged by no less a Palm Springs celebrity than Bob Hope.\n\nAfter a short career as a Las Vegas showgirl, Gentry moved to Los Angeles, attended UCLA (where she was a philosophy major) and worked clerical jobs while occasionally performing in local nightclubs. She later transferred to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music to hone her composition and performing skills.\n\nRise to fame\n\nIn 1967, Gentry recorded a demo and submitted it to Capitol Records executive Kelly Gordon, who quickly signed her to a recording contract and produced her first album. A 45 rpm \"single\" of two of her songs—\"Mississippi Delta\" and \"Ode to Billie Joe\"—was the first issue from this first effort, and even though \"Mississippi Delta\" was chosen for the \"A\" side, radio stations were quickly enamored with the quirky tale of Billie Joe McAllister and the mystery of his fate, as hauntingly performed and recorded on the \"B\" side. Bobbie Gentry had a monster hit on her hands, and Capitol Records had its newest superstar. Gentry went on to win three Grammy Awards that year, including \"Best Vocal Performance by a Female\", and \"Best New Artist.\"\n\nGentry's follow-up albums, The Delta Sweete and Local Gentry, both produced by Gordon, were issued in 1968. Though critically acclaimed, neither album garnered the kinds of sales figures that were realized with Gentry's debut effort. The year 1968 also saw the release of an album of duets that paired Gentry with fellow Capitol alumnus Glen Campbell. Gentry and Campbell's harmonies resulted in a gold record and three hit singles, including a cover of the Everly Brothers hit \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", which rose to No. 6 on the country charts in the winter of 1969.\n\nGentry toured briefly with Campbell and performed on a number of U.S. television programs and specials in the late 1960s. Her other notable singles include Doug Kershaw's composition \"Louisiana Man\" as well as a mellow version of a Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\". The latter went to No. 1 in Great Britain in 1970, a year after Dionne Warwick had a hit with it in the United States. 1970 also saw the release of another U.S. hit with the self-penned \"Fancy,\" which rose to No. 26 on the Country chart and 31 on the Pop chart. (This enduring tale would later be covered with major success by Reba McEntire in 1991.)\n\nGentry would go on to record three more albums, while having earlier albums reissued under different titles. These last three albums, Touch 'Em with Love, Fancy, and the ambitious and highly regarded Patchwork, which consisted of all original material, were greeted enthusiastically by critics but, with the exception of the aforementioned title track to Fancy, failed to resonate with the public (though Gentry did generate a significant fan base in the United Kingdom).\n\nUndaunted by declining record sales, Gentry sought other outlets for her creativity. She continued to write and perform, touring Europe and headlining a Las Vegas review in which she produced, choreographed, and wrote and arranged the music. In 1974, Gentry hosted a short-lived summer replacement variety show, The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour on CBS. The show, which served as her own version of Campbell's hit series The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, also on CBS, was not picked up for a full season. That same year, Gentry wrote and performed \"Another Place, Another Time\" for writer-director (and Beverly Hillbillies actor) Max Baer, Jr.'s film, Macon County Line. Baer would go on to direct a feature film take on Ode To Billy Joe, starring Robbie Benson, in which the mystery of Billie Joe's suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and his emerging homosexuality.\n\nBy the middle 1970s, Gentry's sellability had waned significantly, and Capitol did not renew her contract. After some behind-the-scenes work in television production failed to hold her interests, Gentry decided to retire from show business. Her last public appearance as a performer was on Christmas night 1978, as a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She has deliberately remained out of the limelight ever since.\n\nPersonal life\n\nShe was married twice. The first, to casino magnate William F. Harrah in 1969, when she was 27 and he was 58, lasted only three months, a victim of her fame. The second, to novelty singer-songwriter Jim Stafford, ended in 1979, after only eleven months of marriage and the birth of a son, Tyler. The details of Gentry's personal life after her retirement are little known, but it is generally believed that she has settled into a happy life, and enjoys being a private citizen, unhindered by the scrutiny that fame brings. As of January 2003, she was living in Los Angeles County, California. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bobby Bare": {
    "bio": "Bobby Bare (born Robert Joseph Bare on April 7, 1935 in Ironton, Ohio) is an American country music singer and songwriter.\n\nIn the fifties after many failed attempts to sell his songs, he finally was signed up with Capitol Records and recorded a few rock and roll songs without much chart success. Just before he was drafted into the Army, he wrote a song called 'The All American Boy' and did a demo for his friend, Bill Parsons, to learn and record it. Instead of using the version Bill Parsons did later, the record company, Fraternity Records, decided to use the original demo done by Bobby Bare. The record reached number 2 on the Billboard Top 100, but it was wrongly credited to Bill Parsons.\n\nHis real big break came when RCA boss and guitarist Chet Atkins signed him to the RCA label. The first song he released on this label, 'Shame On Me', sold nearly a million copies and pushed Bobby Bare to fame overnight. His second RCA release, 'Detroit City' won him a Grammy for the best song of the year. Then a surge of hits followed, including '500 Miles Away From Home', 'Four Strong Winds' and others. He has also recorded two very successful albums with Skeeter Davis and has also dueted with Lacy J. Dalton and Rosanne Cash and additionally had a major hit as part of a trio with Norma Jean (singer) and Liz Anderson in 1967 titled 'The Game of Triangles'.\n\nHe moved to Mercury label in 1970 and had two big hits from early Kris Kristofferson compositions, 'Come Sundown' and 'Please Don't Tell Me How The Story Ends' before returning to RCA label where he produced his own records. Later Bare moved to CBS label and in 1979, he helped establish Rosanne Cash's career by singing with her on \"No Memories Hangin' Round\". Bare's singles for Columbia Records included 'The Jogger', 'Tequila Sheila', 'Gotta Get Rid Of This Band', 'When Hippies Get Older' and 'Numbers'. He later recorded for EMI with little success.\n\nBobby Bare is a versatile singer, and in the 70s started to release novelty songs recorded live with selected audiences. One of such songs, 'Marie Laveau' about a witch, reached the number one position on the country chart. This song was written by his friend, a very talented song writer, poet, author and cartoonist Shel Silverstein. He also penned many other songs for Bobby Bare including a Grammy nominated hit called 'Daddy What If' which he recorded with his five year old son, Bobby Bare Jr, who later became a star on his own. Bobby Bare later recorded a very successful album with his family and penned mainly by Shel called 'Singing in The Kitchen'. It was nominated for best group category in Grammy Awards but was declined by Bobby himself.\n\nHe later took chances recording strange, controversial material as 'Dropkick Me Jesus (Through The Goalposts Of Life)' (a 1976 Grammy nominee) and the expletive-driven 'Redneck Hippie Romance' with much success.\n\nBobby Bare is also the first to come up with a concept album called 'Bird Named Yesterday' which was very successful. His most successful concept album is 'Lullaby Legends and Lies'. \n\nBobby Bare was also given an opportunity to star in the movies. He did a Western with Troy Donahue called A Distant Trumpet, and a few episodes of a TV series called No Time for Sergeants. He turned his back on Hollywood to pursue his career in Country Music.\n\nIn 1998 he formed the band Old Dogs together with his friends Jerry Reed, Mel Tillis and Waylon Jennings.\n\nIn addition to the above, Bobby Bare is credited for introducing Waylon Jennings to RCA. He is also one of the first to record from many well known song writers such as Jack Clement, Harlan Howard, Billy Joe Shaver, Mickey Newberry, Tom T. Hall, Kris Kristofferson, and many others. He later had a TV series called 'Bobby Bare & Friends, A Song Writer Showcase'. Recently, he has recorded a new album after over 20 years called 'The Moon Was Blue' produced by his son. His son, Bobby Bare, Jr., is also a musician. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bobby Charles": {
    "bio": "Robert Charles Guidry (February 21, 1938 – January 14, 2010), known as Bobby Charles, was an American rhythm & blues singer and songwriter.\n\nAn ethnic Cajun, Charles was born in Abbeville, Louisiana, and grew up listening to Cajun music and the country and western music of Hank Williams. At the age of 15, he heard a performance by Fats Domino, an event that \"changed my life forever,\" he recalled.\n\nCharles helped to pioneer the south Louisiana musical genre known as swamp pop. His compositions include the hits See You Later, Alligator, which he initially recorded himself as Later Alligator, but which is best known from the cover version by Bill Haley & His Comets, and Walking to New Orleans, written for Fats Domino.\n\n(I Don't Know Why) But I Do was an early 1960s song that Charles composed, which Clarence \"Frogman\" Henry had a major hit with, and which was on the soundtrack of the 1994 film Forrest Gump. His composition \"Why Are People Like That?\" was on the soundtrack of the 1998 film Home Fries.\n\nBecause of his south Louisiana–influenced rhythm and blues vocal style, Charles has sometimes been thought to be black, when in fact he was white.\n\nCharles was invited to play with the Band at their November 26, 1976, farewell concert, The Last Waltz, at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. In the concert, Charles played \"Down South in New Orleans\", with the help of Dr. John and the Band. That song was recorded and released as part of the triple-LP The Last Waltz box set. The performance was also captured on film by director Martin Scorsese, but did not appear in the final, released theatrical version. Charles did, however, appear briefly in a segment of the released film—in the concert's final song, I Shall Be Released. In that segment, his image is largely blocked from view during the performance. That song, sung by Bob Dylan and pianist Richard Manuel, featured backup vocals from the entire ensemble, including Charles.\n\nHe co-wrote the song Small Town Talk with Rick Danko of the Band. Promises, Promises (The Truth Will Set You Free) was co-written with Willie Nelson.\n\nCharles continued to compose and record (he was based out of Woodstock, New York, for a time) and in the 1990s he recorded a duet of Walking to New Orleans with Domino.\n\nIn September 2007, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame honored Charles for his contributions to Louisiana music with an induction.\n\nCharles collapsed in his home near Abbeville and died on January 14, 2010.\n\n----------------\n\nBobby Charles was actually born Robert Charles Guidry in Abbeville, Louisiana circa 1938. A regional New Orleans Swamp Pop fave, whose best known song was \"See Ya Later Alligator\". That track became a top 20 hit on Chess records in 1955, after a southern Louisiana record store owner hipped the Chicago based R&B label. Bill Haley may have made the song even more popular and accessible a year later, but Charles was first out the gate. He recorded more early self composed sides for Chess like \"Ain't Gonna Do It No More\" & \"Take It Easy Greasy\", \"No Use Knockin\" featuring hot backing musicians like Lee Allen on sax, Charles Williams on drums and Justin Adams on gtr. \n\nBy 1958, Bobby Charles (aka on songwriting credits as R.Guidry) started releasing material on The Imperial label. After a year of nominal success  on Imperial the Bobby Charles name began showing up mostly doing other writers material on a variety of mainly one off singles on labels like Farie, Hub City, Jewel and Paula until he simply seems to disappear from the record biz circa 1965. \n\nBy 1972, Charles had resurfaced in Woodstock, NY and released three singles from a self titled album on Bearsville in the early 70's, including production and co-writing credits from  Rick Danko of The Band. Bobby Charles later appeared with Dr. John at The Band's 1978 farewell concert captured on film in The Last Waltz.\n\nHe eventually began putting out albums & later CDs on the homespun indie Rice N Gravy imprint. Other musical collaborators with Charles over the Rice N' Gravy years are notables like Neil Young, Dan Penn, Willie Nelson, Sonny Landreth, Derek Trucks, Wardell Quezergue, Rufus Thibodeaux, Fats Domino and Jon Cleary.\n\nCharles most lasting contributions beyond his early Chess rock n roll rave ups, may have been as a songwriter, contributing what some might call Fats Domino's signature tune \"Walkin To New Orleans\", as well as Clarence Frogman Henry's biggest chart hit \"But I Do\". He is basically retired, living in Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico, but recently shared co-writing credits on six of 13 tracks on the 2008 Dr. John album \"City That Care Forgot\" and came through with \"Homemade Songs\", his first release since his 2004 collection of rarities, \"Last Train to Memphis\". As Bob Dylan said in the liner notes to his 2008 album : 'The boy could sing like a bird. He still does, as a matter of fact.\"\n\nBobby Charles passed away January 14, 2010, at age 71, after collapsing at his home in Abbeville, Louisiana. He was due to release a new album, \"Timeless,\" featuring new material. He saw the final design for the album's artwork, but died only weeks before its scheduled Feb. 23 release.

Gentry went on to win three Grammy Awards that year, including \"Best Vocal Performance by a Female\", and \"Best New Artist.\"\n\nGentry's follow-up albums, The Delta Sweete and Local Gentry, both produced by Gordon, were issued in 1968. Though critically acclaimed, neither album garnered the kinds of sales figures that were realized with Gentry's debut effort. The year 1968 also saw the release of an album of duets that paired Gentry with fellow Capitol alumnus Glen Campbell. Gentry and Campbell's harmonies resulted in a gold record and three hit singles, including a cover of the Everly Brothers hit \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", which rose to No. 6 on the country charts in the winter of 1969.\n\nGentry toured briefly with Campbell and performed on a number of U.S. television programs and specials in the late 1960s. Her other notable singles include Doug Kershaw's composition \"Louisiana Man\" as well as a mellow version of a Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\". The latter went to No. 1 in Great Britain in 1970, a year after Dionne Warwick had a hit with it in the United States. 1970 also saw the release of another U.S. hit with the self-penned \"Fancy,\" which rose to No. 26 on the Country chart and 31 on the Pop chart. (This enduring tale would later be covered with major success by Reba McEntire in 1991.)\n\nGentry would go on to record three more albums, while having earlier albums reissued under different titles. These last three albums, Touch 'Em with Love, Fancy, and the ambitious and highly regarded Patchwork, which consisted of all original material, were greeted enthusiastically by critics but, with the exception of the aforementioned title track to Fancy, failed to resonate with the public (though Gentry did generate a significant fan base in the United Kingdom).\n\nUndaunted by declining record sales, Gentry sought other outlets for her creativity. She continued to write and perform, touring Europe and headlining a Las Vegas review in which she produced, choreographed, and wrote and arranged the music. In 1974, Gentry hosted a short-lived summer replacement variety show, The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour on CBS. The show, which served as her own version of Campbell's hit series The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, also on CBS, was not picked up for a full season. That same year, Gentry wrote and performed \"Another Place, Another Time\" for writer-director (and Beverly Hillbillies actor) Max Baer, Jr.'s film, Macon County Line. Baer would go on to direct a feature film take on Ode To Billy Joe, starring Robbie Benson, in which the mystery of Billie Joe's suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and his emerging homosexuality.\n\nBy the middle 1970s, Gentry's sellability had waned significantly, and Capitol did not renew her contract. After some behind-the-scenes work in television production failed to hold her interests, Gentry decided to retire from show business. Her last public appearance as a performer was on Christmas night 1978, as a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She has deliberately remained out of the limelight ever since.\n\nPersonal life\n\nShe was married twice. The first, to casino magnate William F. Harrah in 1969, when she was 27 and he was 58, lasted only three months, a victim of her fame. The second, to novelty singer-songwriter Jim Stafford, ended in 1979, after only eleven months of marriage and the birth of a son, Tyler. The details of Gentry's personal life after her retirement are little known, but it is generally believed that she has settled into a happy life, and enjoys being a private citizen, unhindered by the scrutiny that fame brings. As of January 2003, she was living in Los Angeles County, California. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

When he moved to Montgomery in 1961, Moore put together a new group, featuring his son, Larry Moore (saxophone), Chico Jenkins (vocals, guitar), Marion Sledge (guitar), Joe Frank (bass), Clifford Laws (keyboards), and John Baldwin, Jr. (drums). They did local Alabama gigs and played behind national touring acts such as Sam Cooke and Ray Charles before signing to Checker Records in 1966.

  "Bonnie Bishop": {
    "bio": "Bonnie Bishop is a singer and a Texan…and, yes, all that insinuates. Brassy, original, soulful, with a whole lot of attitude, her music and her personality are one in the same. But your stereotypical chick singer she is NOT. She sings with the confidence of a woman who understands that the power of her voice lies in her ability to make the audience want more, not want less. She wails effortlessly and with style, free from the shrillness of a woman who is straining to find her notes in the stratosphere, and then just as easily, she swoops down into the depths of her range with a softness that is rich and full of emotion. Walt Wilkins once said, “Her voice can be a tornado through your trailer park or a warm summer breeze across your skin.” Ray Wylie Hubbard also commented “Bonnie reminds me of Marianne Faithful…before she was ravaged by heroin and time.” With her trademark rasp, it is a voice that is both spiritual and sensual, both exhilarating and painful. Coupled with a poignant writing style, this young artist has found a niche that is truly her own, and if talent still has a place in the world of commercial music, in the future we will see Bonnie Bishop sitting at the top of the list as one of the most successful artists of her generation.\n\nBonnie grew up in Houston, where her parents introduced her to soul music at an early age and found that their little girl was a natural performer, dressing up in costumes at family events and hamming it up to Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin songs. She was gifted at musical theater and was formally trained in opera until college, but Bonnie decided she wanted to be a writer, so she began penning her first songs while earning a degree in Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin. In a town legendary for churning out blues players and folkies alike, it is no surprise that, upon graduation, she followed in the footsteps of her musical predecessors and put a band together, booking herself all along the well-known club circuit in Texas and playing everything from rock rooms to dance halls for just about anyone who would listen. Around Texas, Bonnie always stood out at regional festivals and clubs because she was one of very few female artists who was able to make a mark in the male-dominated scene. It didn’t take long before she was sharing bills with artists such as Jack Ingram and Radney Foster and frequenting top venues in the state including Billy Bob’s Texas, Antones, and the Mucky Duck. In 2004, her first full length album “Long Way Home,” was released statewide and saw great success with two singles that stayed on the Texas Music Chart’s Top 30 for over six months. Two years later, she logged over 30,000 miles visiting radio stations statewide to personally promote her second studio album \"Soft to the Touch\", (Smith Music Group) which was produced by Walt Wilkins and featured guests appearances by guitar rocker David Grissom. The title track was a regional hit, a song which Bonnie co-wrote with Ray Wylie Hubbard, and the record received great reviews from Texas magazines and publications as well as a quote by Robert K. Oerman who said, “(Bishop) is an angel with dusty wings…make this Texan a star NOW!” This helped to open doors outside of Texas, and soon Bonnie began touring in the Southeast and Midwest areas. A year later in 2006, she recorded and released the impromptu “Bonnie Bishop and Friends Live at Magnolia Avenue” during an acoustic show in Fort Worth. The double disc became a hit among Texas fans because it showcased the raw power of the singer’s vocals, particularly on her rendition of the classic Cindy Walker tune “You Don’t Know Me”. It was during this time that she caught the attention of legendary singer-songwriter Robert Earl Keen. The two sparked up a close friendship and Bonnie began touring with Keen and his band as an acoustic opener in 2007, which introduced her to a whole new (and much larger!) audience in theaters and rock rooms far beyond Texas on the East Coast.\n\nAmidst a heavy touring schedule, Bonnie taught herself to play guitar and piano over the course of a year, and began making frequent trips to Nashville to collaborate with some of the top songwriters in the industry. On a whim in late 2007, she loaded up her two dogs, two cats, and one reluctant fiancé and relocated among East Nashville's swanky landscape of writers and musicians, where she signed a writing deal with Montage Music Group and began a new chapter of her life as a full-time songwriter. Though she continued to tour acoustically, she spent the better part of 2008 writing and recording her fourth album, titled “Virginia” with well-respected indie guitar player and songwriter Will Kimbrough. Where other producers failed to find a harmonious blend between the singer's Joplin-esque vocals and her sensitive writing style, Kimbrough nailed it by artfully surrounding her raspy voice with soulful rhythms and his own masterfully played guitar parts. The result is a cohesive collection of rock and blues influenced original songs that truly highlight what Bonnie does best.\n\nThough still unreleased, “Virginia” has gained industry’s interest in their new resident, not only for her artistry but also for her songwriting. Recently she has added to her list of co-writers Mike Reid (“I Can’t Make You Love Me”, “My Strongest Weakness”), Walt Aldridge (“Holding Her and Lovin’ You”, “Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde”), and Big Al Anderson (of NRBQ fame) as well as landed herself a spot at this year’s Key West Songwriter’s Festival in May. Bonnie is gearing up for a national tour later this year to promote the new album, but says she is glad for this time that allows her to be a “stay-at-home songwriter” as she recently became a newlywed. While she hopes this record will find a home in radio and that it will give her the opportunity for national success, she feels that whatever happens, she has the responsibility to continue to make music that is uniquely her own. “God blesses us all with unique talents and personalities, so as an artist, I try to make music that is a reflection of that individuality. In the current world of mainstream music, being “unique” or “different” usually means being doomed to obscurity…but that’s something I plan on changing.”  User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Bonnie Raitt": {
    "bio": "Bonnie Raitt, (born November 8, 1949) is an American blues and R&B singer, songwriter, and guitarist who was born in Burbank, California, the daughter of Broadway musical star John Raitt.\n\nRaitt began playing guitar at an early age, something not a lot of her high school girlfriends did. \"I had played a little at school and at camp,\" she later recalled in a July 2002 interview. \"My parents would drag me out to perform for my family, like all parents do, but it was a hobby—nothing more...I think people must wonder how a white girl like me became a blues guitarist. The truth is, I never intended to do this for a living. I grew up...in a Quaker family, and for me being Quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one.\"\n\nIn 1967 Raitt continued her pursuit in that path when she entered Harvard's Radcliffe College as a freshman, majoring in African Studies. \"My plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism,\" Raitt recalled. \"I wanted to help undo the damage that Western colonialism had done to native cultures around the world. Cambridge was a hotbed of this kind of thinking, and I was thrilled.\"\n\nOne day, Raitt was notified by a friend that blues promoter Dick Waterman was giving an interview at WHRB, Harvard's college radio station. An important figure in the blues revival of the 1960s, Waterman was also a resident of Cambridge. Raitt went to see Waterman, and the two soon became friends, \"much to the chagrin of my parents, who didn't expect their freshman daughter to be running around with 65-year-old bluesmen,\" recalled Raitt. \"I was amazed by his passion for the music and the integrity with which he managed the musicians.\"\n\nDuring Raitt's sophomore year, Waterman relocated to Philadelphia, and a number of local musicians he counted among his friends went with him. Raitt had become a strong part of that community, recalling that \"these people had become my friends, my mentors, and though I had every intention of graduating, I decided to take the semester off and move to Philadelphia...It was an opportunity that young white girls just don't get, and as it turns out, an opportunity that changed everything.\"\n\nRaitt eventually went back to school, but her time performing in Philadelphia had encouraged her to pursue music as a career. When Waterman contacted her and invited her to tour with The Rolling Stones, she made a second trip to the admissions office at Radcliffe and told them, \"I'm going to take a leave of absence, but this is only going to last a year.\" As Raitt would later recall, \"Imagine being 20 in 1970—wouldn't you have gone on tour with the Rolling Stones?\"\n\nBy now, Raitt was also playing both folk as well as rhythm and blues clubs in the Boston area, performing alongside established blues legends like Howlin' Wolf, Sippie Wallace, and Mississippi Fred McDowell, all of whom she met through Waterman. In the fall of 1970, while opening for Fred McDowell at the Gaslight Cafe in New York, a reporter from Newsweek Magazine saw her and began to spread word of her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer with Warner Bros. who soon released her eponymously titled debut in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, many of which praised her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, very few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, Give It Up, was released in 1972 to universal acclaim, and though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's Takin' My Time was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.\n\nRaitt was beginning to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for Rolling Stone Magazine, but with 1974's Streetlights, reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By now, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's Home Plate.\n\nIn 1976, Raitt made a notable appearance on Warren Zevon's self-titled album with Warren Zevon's friend Jackson Browne and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\n\n1977's Sweet Forgiveness gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her cover of Del Shannon's \"Runaway.\" Recast as a heavy r&b recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by Al Green, Raitt's version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics, but its commercial success prompted a bidding war between Warner Bros. and Columbia Records. \"There was this big Columbia – Warner war going on at the time,\" recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"James Taylor had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warners signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia — no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"\n\nWarner Bros. held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, 1979's The Glow, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt would have one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) concerts at Madison Square Garden. The shows spawned a three-record gold album as well as a Warner Bros. feature film, No Nukes. The shows featured co-founders Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, John Hall, and Raitt as well as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Doobie Brothers, James Taylor, Gil Scott-Heron, and numerous others.\n\nFor her next record, 1982's Green Light, Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records, but to her surprise, many of her peers and members of the press would compare her new sound to the burgeoning New Wave movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this would have a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Bros.\n\nIn 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, titled Tongue & Groove, Warner Bros. cleaned house, dropping a number of major artists from their roster. Van Morrison and Arlo Guthrie were two of the most high-profile cases, and the day after mastering was completed on Tongue & Groove, Raitt was notified that she was to be dropped too. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a label. By now, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"Sun City,\" the anti-apartheid record written a produced by Steven Van Zandt. Along with her participation in Farm Aid and Amnesty International concerts, Raitt would later travel to Moscow in 1987 as part of the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert later shown on Showtime television. Also in 1987, Raitt would organize a benefit in Los Angeles, for Countdown '87 to Stop Contra Aid, featuring herself, Don Henley, Herbie Hancock, Holly Near and others.\n\nTwo years after dropping her from their label, Warner Bros. notified Raitt of their plans to release Tongue & Groove. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ablility to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as Nine Lives.\" A critical and commercial disappointment, 1986's Nine Lives would be Raitt's last new recording for Warner Bros.\n\nIn late 1987 she joined k.d. lang and Jennifer Warnes as female background vocals for Roy Orbison's television special, Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night. By now, Raitt was clean and sober, having broken her substance abuse — for which she would credit Stevie Ray Vaughan in a Minnesota State Fair concert[1] the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, she began working on new material. During this time, Raitt considered signing with Prince's own label, Paisley Park, but negotiations would ultimately fall through. Instead she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock under the production guidance of Don Was at Capitol Records.\n\nRaitt had met Was through Hal Wilner, who was putting together Stay Awake, a tribute album to Disney music for A&M. Was and Wilner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"Baby Mine,\" the lullaby from Dumbo. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Don to produce her next album.\n\nAfter more than twenty years of singing and recording popular music, Bonnie Raitt achieved immense success with her 10th album. Released in 1989, Nick of Time went to the top of the U.S. charts and won three Grammy Awards. At the same time, she walked away with a fourth Grammy Award for her duet \"In the Mood\" with John Lee Hooker on his album \"The Healer\".\n\nShe followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album, Luck of the Draw, then, in 1994 she added two more Grammy's with her album Longing in Their Hearts. Both of these albums were multiplatinum successes. Raitt's collaboration with Was would amicably come to an end with 1995's live release, Road Tested. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.\n\nFor her next studio album, Raitt hired Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake as her producers. \"I loved working with Don Was but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,\" Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on Fundamental in 1998.\n\nIn March of 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nSilver Lining was released in 2002 while Souls Alike was released in September of 2005.

  "Booker T. Jones": {
    "bio": "Booker T. Jones (born November 12, 1944) is a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, record producer and arranger, best known for fronting the band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s.\n\nBorn in South Memphis, Tennessee, Jones was a child prodigy, playing the oboe, saxophone, trombone, and piano at school and serving as organist at his church. He attended Booker T. Washington High School, the alma mater of Rufus Thomas and shared the hallowed halls with future stars like Isaac Hayes's writing partner David Porter; saxophonist Andrew Love of The Memphis Horns; soul singer/songwriter William Bell and Earth, Wind, and Fire's Maurice White.\n\nJones's first entry into professional music came at age sixteen, when he played baritone saxophone on Satellite (soon to be Stax) Records' first hit, \"Cause I Love You\", by Rufus Thomas and Carla Thomas.\n\nWhile hanging around the Satellite Record Shop run by Estelle Axton, co-owner of Satellite Records with her brother Jim Stewart, Jones met record clerk Steve Cropper, who would become one of the MGs when the group formed in 1962. Besides Jones on organ and Cropper on guitar, Booker T. and the MGs featured Lewie Steinberg on bass guitar and Al Jackson, Jr. on drums (Donald \"Duck\" Dunn eventually replacing Steinberg). While still in high school, Jones wrote the group's instrumental \"Green Onions\", which not only became a hit in 1962, but remains an enduring classic more than 40 years later.\n\nOver the next few years, Jones would divide his time between studying classical music composition, composing and transposition at Indiana University, playing with the MGs on the weekends back in Memphis[1], serving as a session musician with other Stax acts, and writing songs that would become classics. He wrote, with Eddie Floyd, \"I've Never Found a Girl (To Love Me Like You Do)\", Otis Redding's \"I Love You More Than Words Can Say\", and, with William Bell, Albert King's \"Born Under a Bad Sign.\" The latter would later be popularized in the cover version by power trio Cream.\n\nIn 1970, Jones moved to California and stopped playing sessions for Stax, after becoming frustrated with Stax's treatment of the MGs as employees rather than musicians. While still under contract to Stax, he appeared on Stephen Stills' eponymous album (1970). The 1971 album, Melting Pot would be the last Booker T. & the MGs album issued on Stax.\n\nJones produced three albums with his former wife, under the name Booker T. & Priscilla, as well as making the charts as a solo artist in 1981 with \"I Want You\". He produced Priscilla's sister Rita Coolidge, Bill Withers's debut album Just As I Am (on which he also played several instruments), and Willie Nelson's album Stardust. He has also lent his trademark keyboards to everyone from Ray Charles to Neil Young to Natalie Merchant. Jones currently still plays with Booker T. & the MGs and his own Booker T. Jones Band.\n\nJones was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and was honored with a Grammy award for lifetime achievement on February 11, 2007.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "Boz Scaggs (born William Royce Scaggs on 8 June 1944 in Canton, Ohio) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He gained fame in the 1960s as a guitarist and sometimes lead singer with the Steve Miller Band and in the 1970s with several solo Top 20 hit singles in the United States, along with the #2 album, Silk Degrees. Scaggs continues to write, record music and tour.\n\nAfter learning guitar at the age of 12, Scaggs met Steve Miller at St. Mark's School of Texas in Dallas. In 1959, he became the vocalist for Miller's band The Marksmen. The pair later attended the University of Wisconsin together, playing in blues bands like The Ardells and The Fabulous Knight Trains. Leaving school, Scaggs briefly left Texas to join the burgeoning rhythm and blues scene in London. After singing in bands such as The Wigs and Mother Earth, he recorded his first solo album Boz in 1965, which was not a commercial success. He traveled to Sweden as a solo performer and did a brief stint with the band The Other Side with fellow American Jack Downing and Brit Mac MacLeod.\n\nReturning to the US, Scaggs promptly headed for the booming psychedelic music center of San Francisco in 1967. Linking up with Steve Miller again, he appeared on the Steve Miller Band's first two albums Children of the Future and Sailor, which won over critical reviews. After being spotted by Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, Scaggs secured a solo contract with Atlantic Records in 1968. Despite good reviews, his first Atlantic album was met with lukewarm sales, as were followup albums on Columbia Records. In 1976, he linked up with session musicians who would later form Toto and recorded his smash album Silk Degrees. The album reached number 2 on the US charts and number 1 in a number of countries across the world, spawning three hit singles: \"Lowdown\", \"Lido Shuffle\", and \"What Can I Say\", as well as the MOR standard \"We're All Alone\", later a hit for Rita Coolidge. A sellout world tour followed, but his follow-up album, the 1977 Down Two Then Left, lacked the cohesion of Silk Degrees. \n\nScaggs' 1980 album Middle Man would spawn two top 20 hits, \"Breakdown Dead Ahead\" and \"Jojo,\" and Scaggs would enjoy two more hits over 1980 and 1981 (\"Look What You've Done to Me\" from the Urban Cowboy soundtrack, and \"Miss Sun\" from a greatest hits set). \n\nScaggs continued to record and tour sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although he semi-retired from the music business and turned owner of the San Francisco nightclub Slim's. His lengthy hiatus from the music industry slowed his chart career down dramatically.\n\nScaggs recorded Other Roads in 1988, took another hiatus, and then came back in 1994 with Some Change. In the late 190s he released Come On Home, an album of blues, and My Time, an anthology. He garnered good reviews with Dig, although the CD, which was released on September 11, 2001, was lost in the post-911 melée. In May, 2003, Scaggs released But Beautiful, a collection of jazz standards that debuted at number 1 on the jazz charts.\n\nIn 2013 he released the album Memphis User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

Eventually the record company decided to drop The Sandmen and push Brook as a solo artist.\n\nBenton wrote songs for artists such as Nat King Cole, Clyde McPhatter, and Roy Hamilton. Soon he released his first minor hit A Million Miles From Nowhere, and later he joined the Mercury label, which would later bring him big success.\n\nIn 1952 he got his big break with It's Just a Matter of Time and Endlessly. \n\nIt's Just a Matter of Time made it to #3 on the U.S. Pop charts, while Endlessly made it to #12 . Both hits were written by Benton himself. \n\nBenton had many #1 hits including Rainy Night in Georgia and Hotel Happiness. According to  Songfacts, his version of the blues standard The Boll Weevil Song has the unique distinction of being the first #1 song on Billboard's Easy Listening chart.\n\nAltogether, Benton had 38 hit singles through out his career.

  "Bruce Springsteen": {
    "bio": "Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Nicknamed \"the Boss\", he has released 21 studio albums during a career spanning six decades, most of which feature his backing band, the E Street Band. Springsteen is a pioneer of heartland rock, a genre combining mainstream rock music with poetic and socially conscious lyrics that feature narratives primarily concerning working class American life. He is known for his descriptive lyrics and energetic concerts, which sometimes last over four hours.\n\nSpringsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, in 1973. Although both were well-received by critics, neither earned him a large audience. He then changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with Born to Run (1975). This was followed by Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978) and The River (1980), Springsteen's first album to top the Billboard 200 chart. After the solo effort Nebraska (1982), he recorded Born in the U.S.A. (1984) with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album and the 23rd-best selling album of all time as of 2024. All seven singles from Born in the U.S.A. reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, including the title track. Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, Tunnel of Love (1987), Human Touch (1992), and Lucky Town (1992). He reassembled the E Street Band for Greatest Hits (1995), then solo recorded the acoustic album The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995), and the EP Blood Brothers (1996).\n\nSpringsteen dedicated The Rising (2002) to the victims of the September 11 attacks. He released two more folk albums, Devils & Dust (2005) and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006), followed by two more albums with the E Street Band, Magic (2007) and Working on a Dream (2009). The next two albums, Wrecking Ball (2012) and High Hopes (2014), topped album charts worldwide. From 2017 to 2018, and again in 2021, Springsteen performed a critically acclaimed show Springsteen on Broadway, in which he performed some of his songs and told stories from his 2016 autobiography; an album version from the Broadway performances was released in 2018. He then released the solo Western Stars (2019), Letter to You (2020) with the E Street Band, and a solo covers album Only the Strong Survive (2022). Letter to You reached No. 2 in the U.S., making Springsteen the first artist to release a Top 5 album across six consecutive decades.\n\nOne of the album era's most prominent musicians, Springsteen has sold more than 71 million albums in the U.S. and over 140 million worldwide, making him the 27th best-selling music artist of all time as of 2024. He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and the National Medal of Arts in 2023. In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked him 23rd on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", which described him as being \"the embodiment of rock & roll\".

    "bio": "Buddy Guy (born George Guy, July 30, 1936 in Lettsworth, Louisiana) is an American blues music and rock music guitarist, as well as a singer. Known as an inspiration to Jimi Hendrix and other 1960s blues and rock legends, Guy is considered as an important proponent of Chicago blues made famous by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. He has influenced both widely known and local blues guitarists.\n\nGuy is known for his showmanship; for example, he plays with drumsticks and walks into the audience whilst playing, the latter being a gimmick he picked up from a local blues guitarist at an early age (joining or leaping into the audience has also long been common in both American popular and gospel music, as in the earlier work of Big Jay McNeely or the Dixie Hummingbirds).\n\nGuy grew up in Louisiana where he learned to play guitar. In the early 1950s he began performing with bands in Baton Rouge. Soon after moving to Chicago in 1957, Guy fell under the influence of \"Mighty\" Muddy Waters. In 1958 he won a record contract with Artistic Records after beating the West Side guitarists Magic Sam and Otis Rush in a \"Head Cutting Contest\" at the Blue Flame Club. Soon afterwards he recorded for the Cobra label.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Guy was a session guitarist for Chess Records. He recorded on Junior Wells sessions for Delmark Records under the pseudonym Friendly Chap in 1965 and 1966. His career took off during a blues revival period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was sparked by Eric Clapton's request that Guy be part of the '24 nights' all-star blues guitar lineup at London's Royal Albert Hall and Guy's subsequent signing with Silvertone Records.

  "Buddy Holly": {
    "bio": "Charles Hardin Holley (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as Buddy Holly, was an American singer, musician, songwriter, and record producer who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s rock. \n\nHe was born in Lubbock, Texas, to a musical family during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group \"Buddy and Bob\" with his friend Bob Montgomery. In 1955, after opening for Elvis Presley, he decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets, he was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with Decca Records.\n\nHolly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley. Unhappy with Bradley's control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there, he went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of \"That'll Be the Day\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released it as a single credited to \"The Crickets\", which became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the US \"Best Sellers in Stores\" chart and the UK Singles Chart. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"Peggy Sue\".\n\nThe album Chirping Crickets, released in November 1957, reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. Holly made his second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1958 and soon after, toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star Waylon Jennings (bass), famed session musician Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums), and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. After a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, he chartered an airplane to travel to his next show, in Moorhead, Minnesota. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing him, Ritchie Valens, The Big Bopper, and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by Don McLean as \"The Day the Music Died\".\n\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote, recorded, and produced his own material. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. He was a major influence on later popular music artists, including Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Weezer, and Elton John. He was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of \"100 Greatest Artists\".

  "Calexico": {
    "bio": "Calexico are a Tucson, Arizona based, Americana, Tex-Mex, alternative rock, band. The band's two main members, Joey Burns and John Convertino, first played together in Los Angeles as part of the group Giant Sand. They have recorded a number of albums on Quarterstick Records, while their 2005 EP In the Reins recorded with Iron & Wine has reached the Billboard 200 album charts. Their musical style is influenced by traditional Latin sounds of mariachi, conjunto, cumbia, tejano, as well as country, jazz, and post-rock. The band is named for the border town of Calexico, California.\n\nCalexico had its origins in 1990 when Burns, who was studying music at the University of California, Irvine, met up with Convertino, who was playing drums with Howe Gelb in Giant Sand. Burns joined them, after first playing upright bass on a European tour.\n\nGiant Sand moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1994. John and Joey formed the Friends of Dean Martin (later the Friends of Dean Martinez) which scored a record deal with Sub Pop. However, the pair split up with Bill Elm, the co-founder of The Friends of Dean Martinez in 1996. The band subsequently became a kind of indie rhythm section for hire, working with the likes of Victoria Williams, Barbara Manning and Richard Buckner before forming Calexico.\n\nCalexico first recorded Spoke in 1995 for German independent label Hausmusik with a limited edition of 2,000 copies. At that point the band was still called Spoke and the album was technically self-titled. After the band signed with Quarterstick Records (a subsidiary of Touch and Go Records) and changed their name to Calexico, Spoke was reissued by that label in 1997. Burns and Convertino also collaborated with Gelb and Lisa Germano on the album Slush released under the name OP8 that same year.\n\nTheir second album The Black Light was released in 1998. This was a concept album about the desert of Arizona and northern Mexico and received excellent reviews, with the critic from the Wall Street Journal rating it as one of the best records of the year.\n\nThe band built their profile by touring as support acts for bands such as Pavement, the Dirty Three and Lambchop. Calexico has regularly played festivals such as the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Hurricane Festival and All Tomorrow's Parties. The Road Map album was a limited recording released in 1999 for sale only at Calexico's live shows.\n\nCalexico released its third album Hot Rail in May 2000 featuring the addition of horns and violin to their sound. The duo was busy in 2000 as they also appeared on a Giant Sand record called Chore of Enchantment as well as a tour only record Travelall.\n\nAt the end of 2000, Burns and Convertino joined with two French friends Naïm Amor and Thomas Belhôm to record \"Tête A Tête\" (Wabana Records, 2001) released under moniker ABBC (Amor/Belhom/Burns/Convertino). Calexico released two collections of rarities during 2001. Even My Sure Things Fall Through collected outtakes from previous albums, B-sides, remixes and material previously unreleased in the US. The album also featured Mariachi Luz de Luna who frequently played live with the duo. The Aerocalexico album was sold exclusively at their gigs in 2001.\n\nThe Scraping live album was released in 2002. Their next studio recording Feast of Wire was released in 2003 and made the charts for the first time appearing on Billboard's Heatseekers and Independent album chart. They made their first video for \"Quattro (World Drifts In)\" which was a single from Feast of Wire. They released a live DVD in 2004 called World Drifts In: Live at the Barbican. The song \"Güero Canelo\", from Feast of Wire, was featured in Michael Mann's Film, Collateral, starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, in which the band appears.\n\nCalexico contributed the song \"Burnin' Down the Spark\" to Nancy Sinatra's self-titled album in late 2004. The album featured artists who cited Sinatra as a musical influence. The song was released in the UK as the second single from the album in early 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Calexico joined up with Miami-based band Iron & Wine. Howard Greynolds of Overcoat Records was responsible for bringing the two bands together having previously been responsible for Tortoise and Will Oldham recording together. The In the Reins EP was released in September 2005 and received a positive reception with an MSNBC review giving it honorable mention. It also made an appearance in the Billboard 200 album charts, becoming their first recording to make the album charts, and No. 12 on the independent charts. In October 2005, they commenced a US tour with Iron & Wine to promote the record.\n\nReleased in 2006, Garden Ruin is Calexico's fifth studio album and was produced by JD Foster. The sound strays slightly from earlier works, focusing less on the horn section, and placing more emphasis on guitar and vocal tracks, giving the whole album a more mainstream sound.\n\nIn 2007, Calexico was invited by Arcade Fire to record a cover of their \"Ocean of Noise.\" This recording was used as the B-side for Arcade Fire's \"Intervention\" single, originally released on vinyl on May 21, 2007. Also in 2007, Calexico recorded a revamped version of the Bob Dylan song \"Goin' to Acapulco\" for the Dylan biopic \"I'm Not There\". The song featured Jim James of My Morning Jacket on vocals and was featured on the soundtrack of the film.\n\nSeveral of Calexico's songs, usually their shorter instrumental pieces, have been used as interstitial and background music on Public Radio International's This American Life. Their songs \"Ballad Of Cable Hogue\" and \"Service And Repair\" were featured in the 2001 German comedy movie Lammbock.\n\nTheir sixth studio LP is called 'Carried to Dust', featuring Sam Beam of Iron & Wine, Douglas McCombs of Tortoise and Pieta Brown. It was released in the USA via Touch & Go Records on September 9, 2008. The album enjoyed solid reviews, with hometown paper the Arizona Daily Star praising the band's \"ability to sweep you into its world, taking listeners to the American Southwest. This is one of the reasons Europeans love Calexico and others in this country are beginning to come around.\"\n\nOn October 16, 2008, a three-song live acoustic video performance premiered on LiveDaily Sessions, featuring Joey Burns performing the songs \"Two Silver Trees,\" \"Writer's Minor Holiday\" and \"Man Made Lake\".\n\nIn 2009, the song Banderilla was featured in an episode of AMC's Breaking Bad.\n\nIn 2010, a new album of Calexico was released: the soundtrack of the documentary \"Circo\". The band also spent part of 2010 touring with Arcade Fire along the west US coast.\n\nIn May 2011, their song \"Slowness\" was dedicated by Gabrielle Giffords to her husband astronaut Mark Kelly as the wake up song aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its final flight.\n\nAlgiers was released 11 September 2012 on ANTI Records and CITY SLANG (Europe).\n\nIn April 2014, the band began referring to a new album on Twitter in posts from Mexico City, Coyoacan, Mexico, and Athens, Greece. Edge of the Sun was announced on 27 January 2015, and released on April 14, 2015. The album features guest appearances by various artists such as Sam Beam (Iron & Wine), Ben Bridwell (Band of Horses), Gaby Moreno, Carla Morrison and members of the Greek instrumental group Takim.\n\nThe current members of Calexico are:\n\nJoey Burns – vocals, guitars, bass, cello, piano, keyboards, accordion, percussion, vibraphone\nJohn Convertino – drums, percussion, piano, keyboards, vibraphone, marimba, accordion\nPaul Niehaus – steel guitar, guitars\nJacob Valenzuela – trumpet, keyboards, vibraphone, vocals\nMartin Wenk – trumpet, guitar, keyboards, accordion, glockenspiel, vibraphone, theremin (occasionally harmonica & French horn)\nVolker Zander – standup bass, electric bass\n\nLive tour 2013:\n\nJoey Burns - vocals, guitars\nJohn Convertino - drums, percussion\nSergio Mendoza - Keyboards\nJairo Zavala - bazouki, baritone guitar, vocals\nJacob Valenzuela – trumpet, keyboards, vibraphone, vocals\nMartin Wenk – trumpet, guitar, keyboards, accordion, glockenspiel, vibraphone (occasionally harmonica & French horn)\nRyan Alfred - bass, vocals User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Charles Brown": {
    "bio": "Charles Brown (September 13, 1922 – January 21, 1999), born in Texas City, Texas was an American blues singer and pianist whose soft-toned, slow-paced blues-club style influenced the development of blues performance during the 1940s and 1950s. He had several hit recordings, including \"Driftin' Blues\" and \"Merry Christmas Baby\".\n\nIn the late 1940s a rising demand for blues was driven by an increasing white teenage audience in the South which quickly spread north and west. Blues shouters got the attention, but also greatly influential was what writer Charles Keil dubbs \"the postwar Texas clean-up movement in blues\" led by stylists such as T-Bone Walker, Amos Milburn and Charles Brown. Their singing was lighter, more relaxed and they worked with bands and combos that had saxophone sections and used arrangements.\n\nAs a child Brown demonstrated his love of music and took classical piano lessons. Early on, Brown moved out to Los Angeles, where the great influx of blacks created an integrated nightclub scene in which black performers tended to minimize the rougher blues elements of their style. The blues club style of a light rhythm bass and right-hand tinkling of the piano and smooth vocals became popular, epitomized by the jazz piano of Nat King Cole. When Cole left Los Angeles to perform nationally, his place was taken by Johnny Moore's Three Blazers, featuring Charles Brown's gentle piano and vocals.\n\nBrown signed with Aladdin Records and his 1945 recording on that label of the bestseller \"Driftin' Blues\" with a small combo was a typical club blues song. The single was on the R&B charts for six months, putting Brown at the forefront of a musical evolution that changed American musical performance. His style dominated the influential Southern California club scene on Central Avenue during that period and he influenced such performers as Floyd Dixon, Cecil Gant, Ivory Joe Hunter, Percy Mayfield, Johnny Ace and Ray Charles.\n\n\"Driftin'\" was the first of several hits Brown subsequently released \"Get Yourself Another Fool\", \"Black Night\", \"Hard Times\" and \"Trouble Blues\", all major hits in the early 1950s on such labels as Modern Records as well as Alladin. He was unable to compete with the burgeoning rock and roll sound, though he maintained a small and devoted audience.\n\nBrown's approach was too mellow to survive the transition to rock's harsher rhythms, and he faded from the national limelight. His Please Come Home for Christmas, a hit in 1960 on the King Records remained seasonally popular. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, he occasionally recorded and tried to regain some prominence. This continued until the 1980s, when Bonnie Raitt helped usher in a Charles Brown comeback tour.\n\nHe began a recording and performing career again, under the musical direction of guitarist Danny Caron, to greater success than he had achieved since the 1950s. Several records received Grammy Award nominations.\n\nHe is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received both the National Endowment for the Arts' National Heritage Fellowship and the W. C. Handy Award.\n\nBrown died in 1999 in Oakland, California.\n\n.  User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Chris Isaak": {
    "bio": "Chris Isaak (born June 26, 1956 in Stockton, California as Christopher Joseph Isaak) is an American Rock'n'Roll singer, songwriter, and occasional actor.\nIsaak's music can be described as a blend of country, blues, rock'n'roll, pop and surf rock.\n\nHe signed a contract to Warner Brothers Records in 1984 for his first album \"Silvertone\". Isaak's contract was renewed in 1988 when Warner moved him to their Reprise Records label.\n\nHis best-known song is \"Wicked Game\". Though released on the 1989 album \"Heart Shaped World\", an instrumental version of the song was later featured in the David Lynch film 'Wild at Heart' (and also years later in the 2000 film The Family Man). An Atlanta radio station DJ began playing the full version and it quickly became a nation-wide top ten hit. The music video for the song was directed by Herb Ritts and was a big MTV and VH1 hit; shot in black and white, it starred Isaak and model Helena Christensen rolling on the beach, embracing and whispering in each others' ears.\n\nIn 1999, Isaak's \"Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing\" was featured in Stanley Kubrick's final film 'Eyes Wide Shut', starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.\n\nIn 2001, Chris Isaak starred in his own television show, 'The Chris Isaak Show'. It aired from March 2001 to March 2004 in the United States on the cable television network Showtime. This adult comedy show featured Chris Isaak and his band playing themselves with the episode plots based on fictional accounts of the backstage world of Chris Isaak - the rock star next door.\n\nIn 2004, his track \"Life Will Go On\" was featured on the 'Chasing Liberty' soundtrack, which starred Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode.\n\nHe hosted a talk show on the Biography cable channel in the United States in 2009 that offered a unique twist - each guest was a musical artist, and both Chris and the artist performed various songs throughout each show.  Eight episodes aired in early 2009, featuring guests Trisha Yearwood, Stevie Nicks, Glen Campbell, Michael Buble, Chicago, The Smashing Pumpkins, Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens), and Jewel.\n\nIsaak has also appeared in numerous films, mostly playing minor cameo roles, though he starred with Keanu Reeves and Bridget Fonda in the 1993 Bernardo Bertolucci-directed 'Little Buddha', and also played a major role in David Lynch's 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' (1992). Other motion pictures include 'Married to the Mob' (1988), 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991), 'That Thing You Do!' (1996), and 'A Dirty Shame' (2004). He also guest-starred on the Super Bowl Sunday (1996) edition of the television sitcom Friends and on the HBO miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon (HBO).\n\nChris is also an amateur boxer, avid surfer and a former Golden Gloves champion.

He grew up mainly in New Orleans and attended the University of the Americas in Mexico City, planning on becoming an anthropologist, but transferred to Tulane University after a year, during which time he discovered the music of Mississippi John Hurt. While in Paris for a junior year abroad, he spent his time playing guitar rather than attending classes and was kicked out of college as a result. In 1965, he left for Florida to meet Eric von Schmidt, another musical hero of his. von Schmidt encouraged Smither to move to New York City or Cambridge, Massachusetts, and so Smither moved to Cambridge and when he showed up at Club 47, found von Schmidt performing there, who invited him to play a few songs on stage. His first album, I'm a Stranger, Too was released on Poppy Records in 1970. Chris Smither has been touring since then.\n\nChris Smithers song \"Love you like a man\" from Smithers first album has been famously covered by Bonnie Raitt who has made it a signature song of hers under the title \"Love me like a man\" (published on her second Album \"Give it up\")- she has openly expressed admiration for Chris Smithers songwriting and guitarplaying. Later Raitt's version of the song has been covered by The Dixie Chicks and Diana Krall.\n\nThe protagonist of Linda Barnes's series of \"Carlotta Carlyle\" mysteries is a fan of Smither's music and several of her books mention it.\n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Chrissie Hynde": {
    "bio": "Christine Ellen Hynde (born September 7, 1951 in Akron, Ohio) is an American rock musician, best known as the leader of the band The Pretenders. She is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, and the only member of the band to remain constant.\n\nDaughter of a part-time secretary and a telephone company worker, Hynde graduated from Firestone High School, admitting \"I was never too interested in high school. I mean, I never went to a dance, I never went out on a date, I never went steady. It became pretty awful for me. Except, of course, I could go see bands, and that was the kick. I used to go to Cleveland just to see any band. So I was in love a lot of the time, but mostly with guys in bands that I had never met. For me, knowing that Brian Jones was out there, and later that Iggy Pop was out there, made it kind of hard for me to get too interested in the guys that were around me. I had, uh, bigger things in mind.\"\n\nThose \"things\" included Hynde's experimentation with hippie counterculture, psychotropic drugs, eastern mysticism, vegetarianism and of course, joining or starting a band. Soon enough, Hynde joined a band called Sat. Sun. Mat. (which included Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo) while attending Kent State University's Art School for three years. Hynde was on the campus during the infamous \"Kent State shootings\".\n\nHynde also developed an interest in NME when she wasn't waitressing or working various other jobs to support herself, eventually saving enough money for the move from Ohio to London in 1973. With her art background, Hynde landed a job in an architectural firm but left after eight months. It was then that Hynde met rock journalist Nick Kent and landed a writing position at NME. However, it was a short gig among many as Hynde soon found herself working at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's then-unknown clothing store, SEX, where Hynde was summarily fired for a fight with a customer in which Hynde was hit with a bell from the store. Hynde then made a fruitless attempt to start a band in France before her return to Cleveland in 1975.\n\nHardly discouraged, Hynde resurfaced in France in 1976 for another stab at forming a band. Finding her way to London in the midst of the punk movement, Hynde tried to start a group with Mick Jones from The Clash. After the band failed to take off, Malcolm McLaren placed her as a guitarist in Masters of the Backside. But Chrissie was booted just as the band became The Damned. By that time, Mick Jones had invited Hynde to join his band on their initial riotous tour of Britain. Chrissie's recollection of that period: \"It was great, but my heart was breaking. I wanted to be in a band so bad. And to go to all the gigs, to see it so close up, to be living in it and not to have a band was devastating to me. When I left, I said, 'Thanks a lot for lettin' me come along,' and I went back and went weeping on the underground throughout London. All the people I knew in town, they were all in bands. And there I was, like the real loser, you know? Really the loser.\"\n\nBut Hynde's luck soon changed. A demo tape of hers found its way to Dave Hill, owner of the label Real Records. Hill stepped in to manage her career, and began by paying off the back rent owed on her rehearsal room in Covent Garden. Hill also advised Chrissie to take her time and get a band together. In the spring of 1978, Hynde met bassist Pete Farndon through a mutual friend at a bar in Portobello Road. The meeting led to her rehearsal room (described by Farndon as \"the scummiest basement I'd ever been in in my life\") where they started playing \"Groove Me\", by King Floyd, followed by two of Hynde's tunes: \"Tequila\" and \"The Phone Call\". Hynde and Farndon then hooked up with James Honeyman-Scott and Martin Chambers, put the name Pretenders on the group, -- inspired by the song \"The Great Pretender\" -- recorded a demo tape (including \"Precious\", \"The Wait\" and a Kinks' cover, \"Stop Your Sobbing\"), handed it to Hynde's friend Nick Lowe, produced a single (\"Stop Your Sobbing/The Wait\") and performed their first gigs ever in a club in Paris. The single was released in January 1979 and quickly hit the Top Thirty in UK. The band's precocious success was followed by their first gigs in Britain where the band earned wide critical acclaim. In the same spring (1978), The Pretenders recorded their eponymous first album and hit the charts in UK and US with the song \"Brass In Pocket\".\n\nThe Pretenders lineup would change over the years as a result of numerous deaths and internal conflicts. However, Hynde endured, a solid anchor who became the band's eventual leader although Chambers later returned. Her guitar of choice is a Fender Telecaster.\n\nAs the rare, successful female bandleader and style-setter in the early days of punk and new wave, Hynde's impact was pervasive & substantial. Her edginess, punk sensibilities (she gave Sid Vicious his trademark lock necklace), musical vision, lyrical candor & truthfulness in interviews earned the respect of fans, musicians and critics alike, inspiring multitudes of young women to follow. Among many collaborations, Hynde's recordings with UB40 (a cover version of \"I Got You Babe\") and Cheap Trick (\"Walk Away\") have also registered popular success.\n\nChrissie Hynde had a daughter Natalie Ray in 1983 with Ray Davies of The Kinks. A cover version of the Davies song \"Stop Your Sobbing\" had been an early hit for the Pretenders, although Hynde met Davies several years later -- a meeting which bloomed into a long-term relationship. She then married musician Jim Kerr of the band Simple Minds in 1984, and had a daughter Yasmin with him in 1985. They divorced in 1990. She married artist Lucho Brieva in 1997 and lived with him in London until they separated in 2002.\n\nHynde did a duet with INXS on their album Full Moon, Dirty Hearts in 1993. Hynde appears on the title track of the album.\n\nHynde sang the vocals on the Moodswings album Moodfood for track #9, \"State of Independence Part II\" which was played during the closing credits on the soundtrack of Single White Female.\n\nChrissie Hynde has been in the news in recent years as a high-profile animal rights activist. She is a supporter of PETA [1]\n\nHynde recorded a duet with Frank Sinatra on Sinatra's 1994 album Duets II. They performed the song \"Luck Be a Lady\".\n\nIn 1995 Hynde made an acting appearance on the US television comedy Friends.\n\nIn 1999 Hynde played guitar and sang vocals with Sheryl Crow on the song \"If It Makes You Happy\" during a concert in Central Park.\n\nHynde is mentioned prominently in the lyrics of the Terence Trent D'Arby song \"Penelope Please.\"\n\nIn 2004 Hynde moved to São Paulo, Brazil for a couple of months in order to play with Brazilian musician Moreno Veloso in an informal tour that lasted until December 2004. She bought a flat in the Copan Building in Sao Paulo's downtown.\n\nIn 2005, Hynde collaborated with Incubus on a song called \"Neither Of Us Can See\". The song is on the soundtrack album for Stealth.\n\nHynde also recorded a song called \"Cry (If You Don´t Mind)\" with the Spanish band Jarabe de Palo for their album \"Un metro cuadrado - 1m²\".\n\nLikewise in 2005, Hynde dueted with Ringo Starr on a song entitled \"Don't Hang Up\" which can be heard on Starr's most recent album Choose Love.\n\nShe was also the vocalist on Tube & Berger's 2004 #1 Dance Top 40 track \"Straight Ahead\". The track gave Hynde her first US #1 track on the Billboard charts.\n\nShe supplied the voice for the clouded leopard in the movie Rugrats Go Wild (2003) in which she sang a duet with Bruce Willis\n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "Charles Edward Anderson \"Chuck\" Berry (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American songwriter, guitarist, and singer. He is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music.\n\nChuck Berry remains an influential figure and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music who first began performing in 1953.  Cub Koda wrote, \"Of all the early breakthrough rock & roll artists, none is more important to the development of the music than Chuck Berry. He is its greatest songwriter, the main shaper of its instrumental voice, one of its greatest guitarists, and one of its greatest performers.\" John Lennon was more succinct: \"If you tried to give rock and roll another name, you might call it 'Chuck Berry'.\"\n\nBerry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986. He received Kennedy Center Honors in 2000 in a \"class\" with Mikhail Baryshnikov, Plácido Domingo, Angela Lansbury, and Clint Eastwood. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Chuck Berry #5 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was also ranked 6th on Rolling Stone's Rolling Stone's 100 greatest guitarists of All Time.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included three of Chuck Berry's songs (Johnny B. Goode, Maybellene, Rock & Roll Music), of the 500 songs that shaped Rock and Roll.\nChuck Berry held a special place, in terms of sound development, in the formation of, Mersey-Beat at Liverpool. \n\nThe finest exponent of Chuck Berry, guitar, sound at Liverpool during 1959 to 1963, was Vincent Tow/Ismail, who in turn passed on many of the learned skills to Lennon & McCartney, his friends and colleagues during that period--1959 to 1962/3. \n\nChuck Berry  also influenced many of the great rock 'n' roll bands that we know today including The Rolling Stones and The Beatles.

  "Clarence Carter": {
    "bio": "Clarence Carter (born 14 January 1936, Montgomery, Alabama) is a singer and musician.\n\nCarter's earliest releases were as half of the duo Clarence And Calvin. Also known as the \"C And C Boys\", the blind duo made seven singles, the last of which was recorded at Fame's Muscle Shoals studio. When his partner, Calvin Thomas (aka Scott), suffered serious injuries in a car accident in 1966, Carter became a solo act (Calvin himself later reappeared as a solo act to record two Dave Crawford-produced Atco Records singles in 1969/70 and a Clarence Paul-produced 1971 album for Stax Records, I'm Not Blind ... I Just Can't See, from which two singles were also taken). \"Tell Daddy\", released in January 1967, began a fruitful spell of Fame-produced hits by Carter, released on the Atlantic Records label. Noteworthy were \"Thread The Needle\", \"Looking For A Fox\" and \"Slip Away\", where the singer combined his outstanding voice with his skill as an arranger and musician.\n\n\"Patches\", first recorded by Chairmen Of The Board, was a UK number 2 and a US number 4 in 1970, but despite further strong offerings, Clarence was unable to sustain the momentum. He remained with Fame until 1973, where he also helped guide Candi Staton, who was now his wife, before moving to ABC Records the subsequent year.\n\nFurther recordings on Venture and Big C took Carter's career into the 1980s and later the artist found a sympathetic outlet with the Ichiban Records label. Despite being blinded as a child, he developed a distinctive guitar style that complemented his earthy delivery, and was just as comfortable on keyboards, writing songs or arranging sessions. The first two albums, This Is Clarence Carter and The Dynamic Clarence Carter show off his versatile talent to good effect.\n\nClarence returned in the late Eighties with the album Dr. CC, which spawned the bawdy, comedic single \"Strokin'\", which has evolved into a favorite at clubs and weddings. He later followed it up with a sequel, \"Still Strokin'\", in 1989. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Connie Francis": {
    "bio": "Connie Francis (born Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero in Newark, New Jersey on 12 December 1937; died  16 July 2025) was an American pop singer remembered for her international hit songs such as \"Who's Sorry Now?,\" \"Where The Boys Are\", and \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\". She is estimated to have sold more than 200 million records worldwide. \n\nBorn in Italian Down Neck (or Ironbound) neighbourhood of Newark, New Jersey, Francis was one of the most prolific and popular female rock 'n' roll hit-maker of the early rock era -- the late 1950s to the early 1960s. After an appearance on Startime, Francis was advised to change her name from Franconero to something more easily pronounceable, as well as to quit the accordion and focus on singing. \n\nFrancis' first single \"Freddy\" (1955) met with little success. Her next nine singles were also failures, and she began considering a career in medicine; however, \"Who's Sorry Now\" (a cover version of a 1923 song) launched her into super-stardom worldwide. Francis recorded the song at what was to have been her final recording session for MGM, as the label was about to drop her since her previous singles had generated little activity. She has said (paraphrased from The Billboard Book of Number One Singles by Fred Bronson) that she recorded it at the suggestion of her father, who convinced her it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it were released with a more contemporary arrangement.\n\nThe gamble paid off. In April 1958, \"Who's Sorry Now\" reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart (number four in the USA); in 2000, it was named one of the Songs of the Century. On January 1, 1958, she debuted it on Dick Clark's American Bandstand television show; by mid-year over a million copies were sold. This was followed by many other hits over the next decade, as Connie Francis became one of the most popular vocalists in the world.\n\nFrancis specialized in downbeat ballads delivered in her trademark \"sobbing\" style -- such as \"My Happiness,\" \"I'm Sorry I Made You Cry,\" \"Among My Souvenirs,\" \"Together,\" \"Breakin' In a Brand New Broken Heart,\" and the Italian song \"Mama,\" many of which were remakes of old standards. However, she also had success with a handful of more upbeat, rock-and-roll-oriented compositions, such as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Lipstick On Your Collar,\" and \"Vacation.\" Among her other notable performances were \"In the Summer of His Years\" (a tribute to slain U.S. President John F. Kennedy) and Bert Kaempfert's \"Strangers In The Night\" (although the latter song is more identified with Frank Sinatra). Both \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" and \"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own\" went to No.1 on the Billboard music charts in 1960. In 1962 she had another No.1 hit with \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You.\" \n\n\nFrancis recorded in nine languages during her career, including English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, and even Japanese, and remade many of her hits in foreign languages, including \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" and her signature song, \"Where the Boys Are.\" In fact, her biggest hit album in the U.S. was 1960's Italian Favorites, and she followed it with several more albums of Italian songs over the years, as well as collections of Spanish-language and Jewish songs, among others.\n\n\"Where The Boys Are,\" one of many Neil Sedaka/Howard Greenfield compositions Francis recorded during her career (others included \"Stupid Cupid\" and \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\"), gained wide exposure through its inclusion in the 1960 motion picture with the same title. Francis had a role in the film and sang the title song. During the first half of the 1960s she starred in three additional films -- Follow the Boys (1963) (the title song of which became a No. 17 Billboard single for Francis), Looking for Love (1964) and When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965).\n\nIn 1960 Francis became the youngest headliner to sing in Las Vegas, where she played 28 days a year for nine years. In 1961 she was successful in starring in her own television special on ABC television sponsored by Brylcreem titled Kicking Sound Around, singing and acting along-side Tab Hunter, Eddie Foy Jr. and Art Carney. She appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show on July 1, 1962 with French singing star Johnny Hallyday in a show that was taped at the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris, France. On July 3, 1963 she played a Command performance before Queen Elizabeth II at the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland. By 1967, she had 35 U.S. Top 40 hits, and three number ones.\n\nConnie Francis has always been a great fan of country music and recorded several albums of country standards during her pop career. In 1969 she had a modest country hit with \"The Wedding Cake\" and made the country charts again in 1982 with \"There's Still a Few Good Love Songs Left in Me.\" Several country singers found chart success remaking Francis' pop hits for the country market, including Marie Osmond (\"Who's Sorry Now\" in 1975), Susan Raye (\"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own\" in 1972), Margo Smith (\"Don't Break The Heart That Loves You\" in 1978), and Debby Boone.\n\nDuring the height of the Vietnam War in 1967, Connie Francis performed for U.S. troops.\n\nFrancis ended her recording career in 1969. She returned in 1973 with \"The Answer,\" a song written just for her, and soon began performing again. Her son Joey was born in 1974. Tragedies followed soon after. In 1974 she was sexually assaulted in a hotel following a performance in Westbury, New York. Nasal surgery to correct a sensitivity to air conditioning deprived her of her ability to sing professionally for four years. Her brother was murdered in 1981.\n\nFrancis' autobiography, Who's Sorry Now? was published in 1984. Francis was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a mental disease which includes severe depressions and manic highs. She uses the drug Lithium to balance out the emotional highs and lows caused by the disease. Connie Francis resumed her career in 1989 after discovering the drug and has continued singing and recording since then. Francis still holds a world-wide appeal shown through continued music sales and sold-out appearances.\n\nHer CD The American Tour contains performances from recent shows. In late December 2004, Francis headlined in Las Vegas for the first time since 1989. \n\nIn March of 2007, Francis performed to a sold-out crowd -- composed of gay urbanites and conservative suburbanites -- in San Francisco. The \"little diva\" belted out versions of her \"woebegone ballads . . . in full force,\" according to the San Franciso Chronicle's music critic. \n\nConnie's fan club: www.conniefrancis.com User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Dave Alvin": {
    "bio": "Dave Alvin (born November 11, 1955, in Downey, California), is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He has been one of the leading proponents of 'roots' or 'American' music, bringing together elements of rock-and-roll, blues, rural and tejano music.\n\nAlvin and his older brother Phil Alvin grew up loving Americana, country and blues. In 1979 they formed The Blasters with friends Bill Bateman and John Bazz.\n\nShortly after leaving the Blasters, Alvin joined X as lead guitarist after the departure of Billy Zoom. Alvin amicably left the group to work on a solo project shortly after the recording sessions for their album See How We Are. Alvin is also a member of country band The Knitters (composed mainly of members of X), appearing on 1987's Poor Little Critter on the Road and the 2005 follow-up, The Modern Sounds of The Knitters.\n\nIn the early 1980s Alvin, along with fellow Blasters members Bill Bateman and Steve Berlin, performed on several albums with the Los Angeles punk band The Flesh Eaters. These albums are considered precursors to what is now called \"deathrock\". Alvin also played with the band The Gun Club briefly, playing guitar on \"Eternally Is Here\" & \"The Stranger in Our Town\" from the 1984 album, The Las Vegas Story.\n\nAlvin's first solo album, entitled Romeo's Escape (1987) in the United States and Every Night About This Time in England, added a purer country influence along with a larger side-portion of the blues; while the album was critically well received, it didn't fare well in the marketplace, and Alvin was dropped by his American record label, Columbia. Alvin suffered health problems which sidelined him for a while, except for a wild tour with friends Mojo Nixon and Country Dick Montana as the Pleasure Barons, which was described as \"a Las Vegas revue from acts who aren't going to be asked to play Vegas.\" (A live album was released of a second Pleasure Barons tour in 1993.)\n\nIn 1989, Dwight Yoakam scored a hit on the country charts with Alvin's song \"Long White Cadillac,\" and Alvin used the royalties to start work on his second solo set, Blue Blvd. Released by the California-based roots-music label Hightone Records in 1991, Blue Blvd received enthusiastic reviews and sold well enough to re-establish Alvin as a significant artist in the roots rock scene.\n\nAfter releasing Museum of Heart in 1993, Alvin began to turn his attention to acoustic music with 1994's King of California, and over the next several years Alvin moved back and forth between hard-edged roots rock and more introspective acoustic material that still honored his influences (and allowed him to display a greater range as a vocalist).\n\nIn 2000, Alvin recorded a collection of traditional folk and blues classics, Public Domain: Songs From the Wild Land, which earned him a Grammy award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.\n\nIn 2011, Alvin released the album Eleven Eleven on Yep Roc Records. The album was a return to Alvin's rock roots. According to Rolling Stone, \"Though Alvin has often switched between electric and acoustic, almost everything here is plugged in – above all Alvin, an under-recognized guitar hero.\"\nwww.davealvin.net User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",
    "bioSummary": "Dave Alvin (born November 11, 1955, in Downey, California), is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter.

    "bio": "David Grisman (born 1945 in Hackensack, New Jersey) is a noted bluegrass/newgrass mandolinist and composer of acoustic music. He started the Acoustic Disc record label in an effort to preserve and spread acoustic or instrumental music.\n\nDavid Grisman started his musical career in 1963 as a member of The Even Dozen Jug Band. His nickname, \"Dawg\" was affectionately assigned by his close friend Jerry Garcia (the two met at a Van Hoy Campground (NC) back when they used to host the old time fiddlers convention). \"Dawg Music\" is what he calls his mixture of bluegrass and Django Reinhardt-Stéphane Grappelli-influenced jazz, as highlighted on his 1977 album \"Hot Dawg\". Stephane Grappelli played on a couple of tracks on the Hot Dawg album and then the 1981 recording \"Stephane Grappelli and David Grisman Live\". It was his early fusions with Reinhardt-era Jazz that led to the formation of the genre known as newgrass. Grisman, along with New Grass Revival are generally considered the modern day Bill Monroes to this new bluegrass-influenced sound.\n\nDenny Zeitlin, Tony Rice, Mark O'Connor, Béla Fleck, Bob Brozman, Mike Auldridge, Mike Seeger, David Bromberg, Martin Taylor, Del McCoury, Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs, John Hartford, Darol Anger (Turtle Island String Quartet), Sam Bush, and the Kronos Quartet are just some of the musicians that have played with David Grisman or been part of the DGQ (David Grisman Quintet).\n\nThe documentary \"Grateful Dawg\" chronicles the deep friendship between Jerry Garcia and David Grisman. David Grisman appeared on the Grateful Dead's American Beauty album. To this day, Grisman complains of how Jerry Garcia vetoed the length of the mandolin solo featured on the studio version of Ripple. The two recorded a number of duet albums, including the children's album \"Not for Kids Only\". They also played together as the band \"Old and in the Way\" with Vassar Clements, Peter Rowan, and John Kahn, which recorded three different albums.

The debut album Postcards From Downtown (2002) is considered a classic record in the singer/songwriter genre.

  "Def Leppard": {
    "bio": "Def Leppard is an English rock band formed in 1976 in Sheffield. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). They established themselves as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the early 1980s.\n\nThe band's greatest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their first album, 1980's On Through the Night, reached the Top 15 in the UK but received little notice elsewhere. Their second album, 1981's High 'n' Dry, was produced by Mutt Lange, who helped them begin to define their melodic hard rock style, and the album's most popular track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982, but the album only reached the Top 30 and 40 in the UK and US. Def Leppard's next studio album, Pyromania, was released in January 1983, with \"Photograph\" and \"Rock of Ages\" both topping the US Rock Tracks chart and reaching the top 20 of the Hot 100. Reaching No. 2 on the US album chart, Pyromania was certified Diamond in the US and 7× platinum in Canada and reached the top 20 in the UK but did not sell much elsewhere.\n\nDef Leppard's fourth album, the more pop-oriented Hysteria (1987), topped the UK, US, New Zealand, Canadian, Australian and Norway charts. It also went to No. 2 in Sweden and No. 10 in Germany without any Top 50 singles in those countries. It has been certified 12× platinum for sales in the US and 13× platinum in Canada, selling over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album spawned six Top 20 US singles, including the US Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 \"Love Bites\" (went Top 10 in several other countries including No. 2 in NZ), alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" (US No. 2), \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\" (No. 2 in NZ), \"Animal\" (at No. 6, the biggest UK hit), and \"Rocket\" (a Top 15 hit in many countries). Hysteria had four Top 10 hits in New Zealand.\n\nTheir next studio album, Adrenalize (their first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached No. 1 on the UK, US, NZ, Canadian and Australian charts in 1992, while going Top 10 in Sweden and Germany. It contained several hits, including the US Rock Tracks chart-topper, \"Let's Get Rocked\", which became their biggest hit in several countries, including No. 2 in the UK, No. 3 in Canada and Switzerland, and the Top 20 in Sweden and Germany. The third single, \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\", was a Top 15 song in the US, UK and Canada. Adrenalize went on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide. Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic Top 5 North American hit \"Two Steps Behind\". Their greatest hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK No. 2 hit \"When Love & Hate Collide\" and reached the Top 10 in several countries, going 5× platinum in the US. Beginning with Slang, Def Leppard released five albums between 1996 and 2008, with most usually reaching the Top 15 in several countries, including the UK, US and Canada. Their self-titled album was released in 2015 and reached the Top 10 in several countries. The band's newest studio album, Diamond Star Halos was released in May 2022 and reached the Top 10 in the US, the UK and Australia.\n\nAs one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification: Pyromania and Hysteria, making them one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling more than 10 million copies in the US. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and ranked No. 70 in \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".

  "Dion": {
    "bio": "There are at least 2 artists named Dion:\n1) Dion DiMucci, 1960s American singer\n2) Dion, Australian rapper and member of 1Team\n\n1. Dion Francis DiMucci (b July 18, 1939), better known as Dion, is an American singer-songwriter now widely recognized as one of the top vocalists of his era, blending the best elements of doo-wop, traditional pop, and rnb styles, as well as a forerunner in the development of rock and roll.\n\nEarly years\n\nDion was born in Bronx borough of New York City. As a child, he used to accompany his father, a vaudeville entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of country music – particularly Hank Williams – and the blues and doo-wop stars he heard in local bars and on the radio. His singing abilities were honed on the street corners of Crotona Avenue, where he rounded up other local singers inventing acapella licks, and in local clubs.\n\nIn early 1957 he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz, who had just formed Mohawk Records. They recorded him with a vocal group, The Timberlanes, and released a single \"The Chosen Few\", arranged by Hugo Montenegro, which became a minor regional hit.\n\n\nWith the Belmonts, 1957-1960\n\nSchwartz also signed up Dion's friends, The Belmonts, named after nearby Belmont Avenue. Their breakthrough together came in early 1958, when \"I Wonder Why\" made # 22 on the national US charts, followed up with \"No One Knows\" and \"Don’t Pity Me\" which were also chart hits.\n\nThis success won Dion and the Belmonts a place on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. On 2 February 1959, after playing at Clear Lake, Iowa, Dion decided that he could not afford the $36 cost of a flight to the next venue [1]. The plane crashed, and Holly and the other stars were killed.\n\nIn March 1959, Dion and the Belmonts’ next single, \"A Teenager In Love\", was released, making # 5 in the US pop charts and # 28 in the UK. Their biggest hit, \"Where or When\", was released in November 1959, and reached #3 on the US charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked in to hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful, there were musical and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960 Dion decided to quit for a solo career.\n\n\nSolo stardom, 1960-1964\n \n1961 album coverBy the end of 1960, Dion had recorded and released his first solo album, Alone With Dion, and the single \"Lonely Teenager\", which rose to # 12 in the US charts. Follow-ups \"Havin’ Fun\" and \"Kissin’ Game\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with new vocal group the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \"Runaround Sue\", stormed up the charts, reaching # 1 in the US charts in September 1961, and # 11 in the UK, where he also toured.\n\nFor the next single, the record company promoted the A-side, \"The Majestic\", but it was the B-side, Maresca’s song \"The Wanderer\", which received the radio plays and again rose swiftly up the charts, reaching # 2 in the US charts in December 1961 and # 10 in the UK. As a classic oldie, it made the UK top twenty again in 1976.\n\nBy the end of 1961, Dion was a major star, with a worldwide touring schedule, and he followed up with a string of hit singles – \"Lovers Who Wander\" (# 3), \"Little Diane\" (# 8), \"Love Came To Me\" (# 10) and \"Ruby Baby\" (# 2) all making the top ten in 1962. Several of these were written or co-written by Dion. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander.\n\nAt the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records, the first rock and roll artist ever signed to that label. Although the first single, Leiber and Stoller’s \"Ruby Baby\", was a big hit, reaching # 2, several follow-ups were less so, although \"Donna the Prima Donna\" and \"Drip Drop\" both reached # 6 in the charts in late 1963. Nevertheless, problems with his addiction and changing public tastes did cause him to enter a period of commercial decline.\n\n\nChanging fortunes, 1964-1968\nFollowing a European tour, Dion returned to the USA and was introduced to classic blues music by Columbia’s John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon’s \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"Spoonful\", but these releases – some produced by Tom Wilson, with Al Kooper on keyboards - were not commercially successful.\n\nIn 1966, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts for the album Together Again on ABC Records. Again, this bombed, despite one classic self-penned song, \"My Girl The Month Of May\". Although by this stage Dion’s career appeared to be nearing an end, he retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, the only pop artist featured on the album cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967.\n\nIn April 1968, Dion had a powerful religious experience. After getting clean from drug use, he approached Laurie Records for a new contract, and they agreed on condition that he record the song \"Abraham, Martin and John\", written by Dick Holler (also the writer of The Royal Guardsmen’s \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\") in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy during the summer of 1968. The success of this song – later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye – which reached # 4 in the US charts, resuscitated Dion’s career.\n\n\nThe mature period, 1968-1986\n \nBorn To Be With You, 1975For the next few years, Dion’s music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to critical acclaim but moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969.\n\nThere followed a one-off live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden in 1972, released on album. This was followed in 1975 by the album Born To Be With You, eccentrically produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who.\n\nIn 1978 Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, Return of the Wanderer, another critical success and commercial failure. In December 1979 he experienced a life-changing religious experience, documented in this article [1]. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian music vein, in which he released a number of albums on the Dayspring label reflecting his religious convictions.\n\n\nRecent work\nIn 1987 Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. This helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences.\n\nIn 1988 Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled The Wanderer: Dion's Story was published. In the following year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the induction speech being given by Lou Reed.\n\nIn 1989 he returned to secular rock music with the album Yo Frankie, and since then has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His Déjà Nu album in 2000 found him covering Bruce Springsteen, a major follower over the years.\n\nHe joined Scott Kempner of the Del-Lords and Mike Mesaros of The Smithereens in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted.\n\nIn January 2006 he released Bronx in Blue, an album of blues and country standards, which was critically acclaimed and nominated for a Grammy. As a practicing Catholic, Dion pursues prison ministry and reaches out to men going through addiction recovery.\nwww.diondimucci.com/\n\n2. Dion is a musician from Sydney, Australia. Currently, he is part of the 1Team music collective alongside Joeyy, Bic Flame, Facy, B9 and Shotti. Dion has been active since 2016, though he has essentially quit music twice, with large time gaps between any new releases.\n\n(as best we know) Dion has a producer alter-ego: Avail, previously known as Deadman.\n\nDion frequently collaborates with Sudi (another Sydney based artist), Scrap Club (a collective from Stockholm, Sweden) and Redpriest.

  "Dolly Parton": {
    "bio": "Dolly Rebecca Parton (born January 19, 1946 in  Sevierville, Tennessee, U.S.) is an American country singer, songwriter, composer, producer, entrepreneur, author and actress.\n\nParton began performing as a child, singing on local radio and television in East Tennessee. At age 12 she was appearing on Knoxville TV, and at 13, she was recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. When she graduated from high school in 1964 she moved to Nashville, taking many traditional elements of folklore and popular music from East Tennessee with her.\n\nParton's initial success came as a songwriter, with her songs being covered by Kitty Wells, Hank Williams, Jr., Skeeter Davis, and a number of others. She signed with Monument Records in late 1965, where she was initially pitched as a bubblegum pop singer, earning only one national chart single, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" which did not crack the Billboard Top 100. Additional pop singles also failed to chart.\n\nThe label agreed to have Parton sing country music after her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony) went to No. 6 on the country charts in 1966. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but didn't write), reached No. 24 country 1967, followed later the same year with \"Something Fishy,\" which went to No. 17. The two songs anchored her first full-length album, Hello I'm Dolly, that same year.\n\nIn 1967, Parton was asked to join the weekly syndicated country music TV program hosted by Porter Wagoner, replacing Norma Jean. She also signed with RCA Records, Wagoner's label, during this period, where she would remain for the next two decades. Wagoner and Parton immediately began a hugely successful career as a vocal duet in addition to their solo work and their first single together, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind,\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country charts in late 1967, and was the first of over a dozen duet singles to chart for them during the next several years.\n\nParton is a hugely successful songwriter, having begun by writing country songs with strong elements of folk music in them based upon her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings. Her songs \"Coat of Many Colors\" and \"Jolene\" have become classics in the field, as have a number of others. As a composer, she is also regarded as one of country music's most gifted storytellers, with many of her narrative songs based on persons and events from her childhood.\n\nIn 1982 Dolly Parton sang her song \"I Will Always Love You\", for the movie \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", starring Parton and Burt Reynolds. The song - originally composed around 1974 - made few ripples, but it wasn't until Whitney Houston re-recorded it for \"The Bodyguard\" a decade later, that the song made yet another international hit for Dolly Parton. She later put out her own version on the 1996 album of the same name.\n\nIn 1987, Parton left her longtime label, RCA, and signed with Columbia Records, where her recording career continued to prosper, but by the mid 1990s, Parton, along with many other performers of her generation, found that her new music was not welcome on country radio playlists. She recorded a series of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums, beginning with \"The Grass is Blue\" (1999) and \"Little Sparrow\" (2001), both of which won Grammy Awards. Her 2002 album \"Halos and Horns\" included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin classic Stairway to Heaven. In 2005, Parton released Those Were The Days, her interpretation of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s through early 1970s. The CD featured such classics as John Lennon's \"Imagine,\" Cat Stevens' \"Where Do The Children Play,\" Tommy James' \"Crimson & Clover,\" and the folk classic \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\", as well as the title track.\n\nIn 2007, Dolly paved new musical ground by forming her own record label, Dolly Records. The label's first release - Backwoods Barbie - debuted at #2 on the Billboard country albums charts and marks Parton's first mainstream country album in 17 years. Parton is touring North America and Europe throughout 2008 in support of her latest release.\n\n1955 User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "Don Covay (born Donald Randolph, March 24, 1938 – January 30, 2015) was an American R&B, rock and roll and soul singer and songwriter most active in the 1950s and 1960s. He received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1994. \n\nDonald Randolph was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, United States. His father a Baptist preacher died when Don was eight. Covay resettled in Washington D.C. during the early 1950s and initially sang in the Cherry Keys, his family's gospel quartet. He crossed over to secular music with the Rainbows, a formative group which also included Marvin Gaye and Billy Stewart. Covay's solo career began in 1957 as part of the Little Richard Revue.\n\nA single \"Bip Bop Bip\" was released on Atlantic and produced by Little Richard, on which Covay was billed as \"Pretty Boy\". It also featured his backing band the Upsetters. Over the next few years Covay drifted from label to label, but a further dance-oriented track called \"Popeye Waddle\" was a hit in 1962. He also wrote and recorded \"Pony Time\" which later became a US #1 single for Chubby Checker. Covay meanwhile honed his songwriting skills by penning a hit for Solomon Burke, \"I'm Hanging Up My Heart for You\", while Gladys Knight & The Pips reached the US Top 20 with \"Letter Full of Tears\".\nCovay's singing career continued to falter until 1964, when he signed to the Rosemart label. His debut single there with the Goodtimers, \"Mercy Mercy\" (accompanied by a young Jimi Hendrix on guitar), established his earthy bluesy style. Atlantic bought his contract, but, while several R&B hits followed, it was a year before Covay returned to the pop chart. \"See Saw\", co-written with Steve Cropper and recorded at Stax, paved the way for more hits.\nDon Covay's songs still remain successful: Aretha Franklin won a Grammy for her performance of his composition \"Chain of Fools\". He is a legendary composer and singer, best known for his R&B classic compositions \"Mercy Mercy\", \"Chain of Fools\", \"See Saw\" and \"Sookie Sookie\". Covay had success as a singer as Don Covay and The Goodtimers, and his compositions have been recorded by such varied artists as Steppenwolf, Bobby Womack, The Rolling Stones, Wilson Pickett, The Small Faces, Grant Green, Peter Wolf and many more.\n\nDon Covay had a stroke in 1992, and the following year Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones appeared, with Iggy Pop, Todd Rundgren and others on a Covay tribute album Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay. The same year he was presented by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation with one of its Pioneer Awards.\n\nHe released an album Adlib in 2000 on the Cannonball label, his first album in 23 years. Collaborating musicians included Paul Rodgers, Wilson Pickett, Lee Konitz, Otis Clay, Kim Simmonds, Ann Peebles, Syl Johnson, Paul Shaffer, Huey Lewis, and Dan Penn. The cover art was by Ronnie Wood.\n\nCovay died on January 30, 2015 at the age of 76. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "Don Henley (born Donald Hugh Henley in Gilmer, Texas, USA on 22 July 1947) is a drummer, singer, and songwriter with the band Eagles. Since the 80s, he has had a successful solo career with the albums: I Can't Stand Still, Building The Perfect Beast, The End of Innocence  and Inside Job and he has played a founding role in several causes. His most well known songs are the hit songs The Boys of Summer ,All She Wants to Do Is Dance ,  Dirty Laundry, and  The End Of The Innocence\n\nIn 1970, he moved to Los Angeles to record an album with his early band, Shiloh. Shiloh's album was produced by fellow Texan Kenny Rogers. Shortly thereafter, Henley met Glenn Frey. They both became members of Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Touring with her was the catalyst for forming the group. As a result, two months later they, along with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner, became their own act, Eagles.\n\nHenley's music is often social commentary. One of his more famous songs is \"Dirty Laundry\" (from his I Can't Stand Still album, released in 1982). Its origins date back to 1980, when Henley was put on probation for possession of a narcotic and fined for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The ensuing media circus and on-air pundits claiming that his career was over led to the writing of the song, which continues to be an indictment against the broadcast news media. Similarly, \"Johhny Can't Read\"  (also from the Can't Stand Still album), continues to resound as a commentary on the educational system.

He was variously known as Mac Rebennack, Dr. John Creaux, Dr. John, the Night Tripper.\n\nDr. John began making his own idiosyncratic music in the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (\"the lowest time of my life\"), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Dr. John, The Night Tripper. The name \"Dr. John\" came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.\n\nDr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits' \"Luv dat chicken...\" jingle, as well as the theme song (\"My Opinionation\") for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom.

This is the group on the second session, which produced the group's first major hit: \"Money Honey\".\n\nAfter the session, Ferbee was involved in an accident and left the group and Adams died (to be replaced by Jimmy Oliver). Ferbee was not replaced and the voice parts were shifted around: Gerhart Thrasher became first tenor, Andrew Thrasher was now the baritone, and Bill Pinkney shifted down to bass. The group released several more hits (\"Such A Night,\" [1][2] \"Honey Love,\" \"Bip Bam,\" \"White Christmas,\" and \"What'cha Gonna Do\") before McPhatter was drafted in May 1954 (after which he pursued a solo career). McPhatter had demanded a large share of the group's profits, which he had been denied in The Dominoes, but, upon his departure, did not ensure that this would continue for his successor. He sold his share of the group to [bandmember from=1953 to=1956[artist]George Treadwell, manager, former jazz trumpeter, and husband of legendary singer Sarah Vaughan. As a result, the Drifters cycled through copious members, none of whom made much money. McPhatter later expressed regret at this action, recognizing that it doomed his fellow musicians to unprofitability.\n\nMcPhatter was first replaced by David Baughn, who was on the group's first session. While his voice was similar to McPhatter's, his erratic behavior made him unsuitable in the eyes of Atlantic Records executives. Baughn soon left the group, and was replaced by Cleveland native Johnny Moore (of The Hornets). This lineup had a major R&B hit in 1955 with \"Adorable,\" followed by several others (\"Ruby Baby,\" \"I Got To Get Myself A Woman,\" and \"Fools Fall In Love\"). Johnny Moore was drafted in November 1957 and replaced by Bobby Hendricks (who had briefly been with The Swallows), but to no success; the group was not able to break into mainstream markets.\n\nIn the mid 1950s, the Drifters began working with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, legendary songwriters, who eventually became the group's producers as well. This is widely considered the group's golden age, inaugurated by the 1956 hit \"(April, 1993)I Gotta Get Myself a Woman.\" Low salaries contributed to burnout among the members, particularly Bill Pinkney, who was fired after asking Treadwell for more money. Andrew Thrasher left as well, in protest. Pinkney formed another group, called The Flyers, with lead singer Bobby Hendricks (before he joined the Drifters to replace army-bound Johnny Moore).\n\nBill Pinkney was replaced by Tommy Evans (who had replaced Jimmy Ricks in The Ravens). Charlie Hughes, a baritone, replaced Andrew Thrasher. By early 1958, the lineup was: Bobby Hendricks (lead tenor), Gerhart Thrasher (first tenor), Jimmy Milner (baritone), Tommy Evans (bass), and Jimmy Oliver (guitar). By May 1958, both Hendricks and Oliver had quit, returning only for a week's appearance at the Apollo Theater. During that week, one of the members got into a fight with the owner of the Apollo. That was the last straw for manager George Treadwell, who fired the entire group.\n\nSince Treadwell owned the rights to the name \"Drifters,\" and since he still had a year's worth of bookings for the Apollo, he recruited another group, The Five Crowns, featuring lead singer Ben E. King. The group changed its name to the \"Drifters\" and went out on the road to tour for almost a year, although this new group had no connection to the prior Drifters.\n\n\nBill Pinkney's \"Original Drifters\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Pinkney and other \"fired\" Drifters once again joined with the Thrashers and David Baughan to begin touring as \"The Original Drifters\" (although their first recordings, for End in 1959, were as the \"Harmony Grits\"). Baughan left after a short time, leaving the group a trio. Bobby Lee Hollis joined in 1964 and took over the lead spot. Later that year, Andrew Thrasher was out and Jimmy Lewis was in. Bobby Hendricks returned, making the group a quintet for a short time, before Lewis left. Andrew Thrasher returned, replacing Hollis. Hollis and Baughan bounced in and out through the 1960s. By 1968, the group was Pinkney, Gerhart Thrasher, Hollis, and Hendricks. At this point, the group split.\n\nPinkney met with an existing group, The Tears, and recruited them as the new Original Drifters. The Tears were Benny Anderson, George Wallace, Albert Fortson, and Mark Williams. Shortly after recruiting them, they broke away from Pinkney and continued touring as the Original Drifters for over a decade (Pinkney filed suit and successfully stopped them at that time).\n\nPinkney then brought in new members Bruce Caesar, Clarence \"Tex\" Walker, and Bruce Richardson. The lineup changed rapidly. In 1979 the group was Pinkney, Andrew Lawyer, Chuck Cockerham, Harriel Jackson, and Tony Cook. Their 1995 album Peace in the Valley, on Blackberry Records, credited vocals to Pinkney, Cockerham, Richard Knight Dunbar, Vernon Young, and Greg Johnson. [3][4] They appeared on the PBS special, Doo Wop 51 with Pinkney, Dunbar, Johnson, and Bobby Hendricks. The current lineup is Pinkney, Cockerham, Dunbar, Young, and Clyde McPhatter's son, Billy McPhatter. Greg Johnson is now in Bobby Hendricks' Drifters.\n\n\nThe second Drifters\n\nTreadwell had approached Lover Patterson, the manager of The Five Crowns. All but one member of The Five Crowns went along with the name change to become the Drifters. The new line-up consisted of: Benjamin Earl Nelson (known professionally as Ben E. King; lead tenor), Charlie Thomas (tenor), Dock Green (baritone), and Elsbeary Hobbs (bass). James \"Poppa\" Clark was the fifth member; he was not included in the new group.\n\nThis new lineup released several singles that became chart hits: \"There Goes My Baby,\" the first commercial rock-and-roll recording to include a string orchestra, \"Dance With Me,\" \"This Magic Moment,\" \"Save The Last Dance For Me,\" and \"I Count The Tears.\" However, personnel changes started almost immediately. Lover Patterson (who had managed the Five Crowns and was now the Drifters' road manager) got into a fight with George Treadwell. Since Patterson had Ben E. King under personal contract, he refused to let King tour with the group. Thus, King continued to record with the group for about a year before beginning a successful solo career. New member Johnny Lee Williams did the touring (although he can be heard leading \"True Love, True Love\"). Williams was subsequently replaced by Rudy Lewis (of The Clara Ward Singers), who led the Drifters on hits such as \"Some Kind Of Wonderful,\" \"Please Stay,\" and \"Up on the Roof.\" While recording \"Please Stay,\" songwriter Burt Bacharach met Dionne Warwick, a backup singer, thus beginning a legendary partnership.\n\nBass Elsbeary Hobbs was drafted and eventually replaced by the returning Tommy Evans (from the 1958 group). Dock Green left in 1962 and was replaced by Eugene Pearson (of The Rivileers and Cleftones). Tommy Evans left again in 1963 and was replaced by Johnny Terry. After his military service and a failed solo career, Johnny Moore returned in 1964, making the group a quintet of Moore, Charlie Thomas, Rudy Lewis, Gene Pearson, and Johnny Terry.\n\nLater that year, the group was scheduled to record \"Under the Boardwalk\" on May 21. However, Rudy Lewis died the night before the session, and Johnny Moore took over as the sole lead (he and Lewis had been alternating). Terry was replaced in 1966 by Dan Dandridge for a couple of months, then by William Brent, who had been with Johnny Moore in The Hornets in 1954. Gene Pearson was replaced by Rick Sheppard that same year. By late 1966, baritone/bass Bill Fredricks replaced William Brent. Charlie Thomas, the group's last \"original member\" (from the day The Five Crowns had become the Drifters), left in mid-1967 and was replaced by Charles Baskerville, a former member of The Limelites. Baskerville stayed only a short time, leaving before a session (which was done as a trio). Baritone Milton Turner was added by the end of 1967. In late 1969, Milton Turner left and was replaced by another singer named Charlie Thomas (who took the nickname Don Thomas to avoid confusion with the former member). This lineup lasted only a few months. By March 1970, the Drifters had broken up. Johnny Moore and Bill Fredericks reunited in January 1971 (along with two unknown singers) to do an independently-produced session that was subsequently sold to Atlantic. \"A Rose By Any Other Name\" and \"Be My Lady\" became the Drifters' last Atlantic release.\n\n\nPost-Atlantic career\n\nAfter this, the Drifters moved to [place[England[/place] and underwent the usual bewildering personnel changes. Throughout the 1970s, the only charted records for the group were on the British charts - notably \"Kissing In The Back Row Of The Movies\", \"There Goes My First Love\" and \"You're More Than A Number In My Little Red Book\". Along with Moore and Fredricks, Butch Leake and former Ink Spots mamber Grant Kitchings[/bandmember were members initially. Fredricks was replaced by [bandmember]Clyde Brown the next year, and Kitchings by Billy Lewis the year after. Leake was replaced by Joe Blunt in 1976, making the lineup Johnny Moore, Clyde Brown, Joe Blunt, and Billy Lewis. This year, Faye Treadwell renamed the group's management company Treadwell Drifters Inc.\n\nMoore left in 1978 and was replaced by Ray Lewis. Blunt and Billy Lewis left in 1979 and were replaced by the returning Johnny Moore and former Temptations lead Louis Price. Moore left again in late 1982, along with Clyde Brown. They were replaced by two returning members, Ben Nelson (a.k.a. Ben E. King) and Bill Fredricks.\n\nAround this time, members left and rejoined frequently. Fredricks, Lewis, and Price left in 1983 and were replaced by the returning Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown. In 1986, the group changed all of its members and the new lineup consisted of new member Jonah Ellis and former members Ray Lewis, Billy Lewis, and Louis Price. The next year, more former members came in as replacements, making the group Moore, Billy and Ray Lewis, and Gene Jenkins (replaced shortly after by George Chandler, then John Thurston). Ray Lewis was out in 1988, and was replaced by Joe Cofie. In 1989, Billy Lewis left, and replaced by the returning George Chandler, then Tony Jackson, Keith John, and finally Peter Lamarr in 1990.\n\nThurston was out at the end of the year and was replaced by Roy Hemmings. Patrick Alan was in for Lamaar briefly. Lamaar left in 1991 and was replaced by Rohan Delano Turney. This lineup lasted until 1996, when Cofie was out and Jason Leigh was in. Leigh was replaced after two years by the returning Peter Lamarr.\n\nTragedy struck in 1999 when the group's longest serving member, Johnny Moore, died. Patrick Alan returned to the group, keeping it a quartet. Lamarr left again in 2003, and was replaced by Victor Bynoe. Hemmings left in 2004 and was replaced by the again-returning Lamarr. The group's current lineup is Peter Lamarr, Rohan Delano Turney, Patrick Alan, and Victor Bynoe. [5] This line up is fully endorsed by Johnny Moore's wife and in Allan, Lamarr and Turner actually contains three of the longest serving Drifters members.\n\nIn 2001, Faye Treadwell left the United Kingdom, allegedly due to bankruptcy. Two members of her company, Mark Lundquist and Phil Lunderman, started a new management company, Drifters UK Limited, to run the group. Their new duties included stopping a patent by an imposter Drifters group. [6][7]\n\nAs of December 2006, writs have been served in the London High Court by Tina Treadwell, daughter of George and Faye, against Lundquist and Lunderman, alleging they are not the rightful controllers of The Drifters. Tina's group features Roy Hemmings and Jason Leigh. It should be noted that Hemmings remained with Lundquist and Lunderman initially, leaving three years after the formation of Drifters UK Limited.[8][9] It will be interesting to see how things transpire should Treadwell win her case, since the current Drifters lineup touring the UK has built up a fan base selling out one tour after another with Johnny Moore and continuing after his death. The Vocal Group Hall of Fame has inducted both 'The Original Drifters' (1998) and 'Ben E. King and The Drifters'(2000).\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked The Drifters #81 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[1]\n\nOn July 4, 2007, Bill Pinkney died of a heart attack in his room at the Hilton Hotel, Daytona Beach, Florida, where he was in town to perform for the 4th of July Red, White and Boom Event.[2]\n\nIn 2009, the lineup consists of Damion Charles, Michael Williams, Steve V. King and Maurice Cannon. For tour dates  and more info go to www.theofficialdrifters.com  \n\n\n\nThere was also a Japanese vocal group called the Drifters although the romanisation of their name (ザドリフタース)　yields many variations: Doriftas, Dorifutas, Dorihutasu, etc. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Elton John": {
    "bio": "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is a British singer, pianist, and composer. Collaborating with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967, John is one of the most successful artists of all time, having sold over 300 million records worldwide in a seven-decade career in music. He is acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his work during the 1970s, and his lasting impact on the music industry. John's music and showmanship have had a significant impact on popular music. His songwriting partnership with Taupin is one of the most successful in history.\n\nJohn was raised in the Pinner suburb of London and learned to play piano at an early age, forming the blues band Bluesology in 1962. After leaving Bluesology in 1967 to embark on a solo career, John met Taupin after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician for artists. John released his debut album Empty Sky in 1969, and a year later formed the Elton John Band and released his first hit single, \"Your Song\".\n\nJohn's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s when he released a streak of chart-topping albums in the US and UK, which began with Honky Château (1972) and culminated with Rock of the Westies (1975). John continued his success in the 1980s and 1990s, having several hit singles and albums in both decades, and has continued to record new music since then. He has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing music for The Lion King, Aida, and Billy Elliot the Musical. In 2018, John began his ongoing farewell tour Farewell Yellow Brick Road, which is scheduled to conclude in 2023. The 2019 biopic Rocketman dramatized his life and career.\n\nOutside of music, John is an HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser and has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. He established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992, which has raised over £300 million since its inception, and a year later he began hosting his annual Foundation Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the biggest high-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. John was the chairman and director of Watford F.C, from 1976 to 1987, and again from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, John developed a severe addiction problem to drugs and alcohol but has been sober since 1990. He entered into a civil partnership with Canadian filmmaker David Furnish in 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014.\n\nJohn has sold over 300 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100, including nine number-ones in the UK and US, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the US. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", a rewritten version of his 1974 single in dedication to Princess Diana, sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling chart single of all time. In 2021, John became the first solo artist with UK Top 10 singles across six decades.\n\nJohn has received numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards; including for Outstanding Contribution to Music; two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Tony Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, a Disney Legend Award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and is a fellow of The Ivors Academy. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music and charitable services in 1998 and was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by King Charles III (then Prince of Wales) in 2020.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John\n\nSolo studio albums\nEmpty Sky (1969)\nElton John (1970)\nTumbleweed Connection (1970)\nMadman Across the Water (1971)\nHonky Château (1972)\nDon't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player (1973)\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\nCaribou (1974)\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (1975)\nRock of the Westies (1975)\nBlue Moves (1976)\nA Single Man (1978)\nVictim of Love (1979)\n21 at 33 (1980)\nThe Fox (1981)\nJump Up!

  "Elvin Bishop": {
    "bio": "Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, is an American blues and rock and roll musician and guitarist. \n\nRemembered by many these days as a founding member of the groundbreaking Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop has also tasted pop success with his 1976 smash hit “Fooled Around and Fell In Love.” Bishop’s long and varied career has included other musical stops along the way as well, from deep down gutbucket blues played in smoky South Side Chicago taverns, to raucous roadhouse R&B, to rollicking good time rock & roll. And at every stage along the way, he’s imbued all of his music with deep passion, a uniquely creative spirit, and more than a little bit of sly humor.\n\nBorn and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Elvin Bishop didn’t have much exposure to live music as a youngster. But his family had a radio, and in between the pop schmaltz and the C&W that ruled the airwaves in the 1950s, that radio could sometimes catch the legendary R&B programming beamed throughout the southern part of the U.S. at night by Nashville radio station WLAC. That station introduced Bishop to the classic records of Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and once his ears had been hooked, there was no turning back for young Elvin. He soon got his first guitar and on his own began scratching out the basic outlines of the blues, R&B and rock & roll that had captured his imagination.\n\nBy the time he was preparing to go to college in the late 1950s, Bishop had earned a National Merit Scholarship, allowing him to go to almost any school he chose – and there was only one choice on Elvin’s mind, the prestigious University of Chicago, which just happened to be located on Chicago’s South side, ground zero for much of the urban blues Elvin had been studying only from a distance. He arrived in Chicago in 1959, and before long crossed paths with a kindred spirit in Paul Butterfield. Together, they explored the ghetto blues clubs in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university campus at a time when blues giants like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Otis Rush, Magic Sam and Howlin’ Wolf could be found playing in neighborhood joints on a weeknight. Elvin soaked it all up, gaining impromptu lessons and invaluable stage time in front of discerning audiences, and forging a fluid yet powerful guitar style of his own.\n\nBy 1963, Bishop and Butterfield were ready to graduate – not necessarily from the university, but certainly from their apprenticeship under Chicago’s blues elders. Recruiting Howlin’ Wolf’s former rhythm section of Sam Lay on drums and Jerome Arnold on bass, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band was born. In 1965, after adding Mike Bloomfield and Mark Naftalin to the lineup, their revolutionary debut LP was released, kicking open the door for virtually all the young white blues bands that followed.\n\nBishop remained in the fold for three albums with the Butterfield band, including their innovative “East-West” release (on which Bishop and Bloomfield’s intertwining guitars helped set the stage for the Allman Brothers Band among many others who followed), before venturing out on his own. Elvin released four well-received albums on Epic Records in the early ‘70s, before joining Capricorn Records for a couple of LPs and experiencing his biggest pop success, the national hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” from his 1976 LP “Struttin’ My Stuff”.\n\nAs popular musical trends evolved, the recording projects tapered off, but road work kept Elvin busy through the ‘80s, and by the time he hooked up with Alligator in 1988, he was returning to his bluesy roots. And that fertile territory has been his focus ever since.\n\nDelta Groove Productions president Randy Chortkoff has been a fan and follower of Elvin’s music through all the many phases of his career, beginning with Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s, so when the opportunity arose to bring Elvin into the Delta Groove fold, Chortkoff jumped at the opportunity. The result was Elvin’s Grammy nominated 2008 CD “The Blues Rolls On”, a project supported by an all-star cast of blues royalty featuring B.B. King, Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood , James Cotton, Kim Wilson, Tommy Castro, John Németh, Angela Strehli, plus many more.\n\nElvin’s brand new release “Red Dog Speaks”, his second on Delta Groove Music, is the exciting next step in his blues journey. Right out of the gate, Bishop leaves no doubt where his heart is, cleverly introducing his long-time cohort - a 1959 Gibson ES-345 that lovingly answers to the name of “Red Dog”, with a gritty slow blues calculated to set the pace for what’s to come. Along the way he smoothly steers the way from strutting blues and R&B, to a good dose of good-time rock & roll, and even an occasional detour through doo-wop, zydeco and gospel. Elvin has made plenty of talented friends over the years, and many of them jumped at the chance to help out including John Nemeth, Buckwheat Zydeco, Roy Gaines, Tommy Castro, Ronnie Baker Brooks, and Kid Andersen who all make guest appearances. And all of it adds up to an amalgam that can only be called “Elvin Bishop music.”\n\nBishop's official website is at http://www.elvinbishopmusic.com/ User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Elvis Costello": {
    "bio": "Elvis Costello (born Declan Patrick MacManus on 25 August 1954) is an internationally known English singer-songwriter. Gaining prominence as an early participant in London's pub rock scene in the mid-70s, he burst into fame with his critically acclaimed 1977 debut 'My Aim Is True', still one of the most successful debuts of all time. He soon did much work in the genres of punk rock, power pop, and New Wave after he formed Elvis Costello & The Attractions. In a long and successful career, Costello has released over thirty studio albums on his own and with the Attractions, the Imposters, and other collaborations, praised by many critics for his literate, witty songwriting.\n\nBorn in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington in London, Costello is the son of trumpeter, vocalist and band-leader Ronald (“Ross”) MacManus and record store manager Lillian Costello. His family had roots in Merseyside and he moved to Birkenhead at age 16, with his mother, when his parents separated. While he is better known as 'Elvis Costello', a stage name referring to the legendary Elvis Presley suggested by Stiff Records manager Jake Riviera, he has used many other aliases, including 'The Imposter' and 'Napoleon Dynamite'.\n\nIn the early 1970s Costello was a participant in London's pub rock scene with the group Flip City. Then in 1977 along with fellow Pub-Rockers Nick Lowe and Ian Dury he made his first releases on the independent label Stiff, tailoring his work towards the burgeoning punk, power pop, and new wave scenes. From 1980's Armed Forces onwards, however, other influences including soul, country, 1960s pop, and classical music began to re-emerge, and he soon became established as a unique and original voice. His output has been wildly diverse: one critic has written that \"Costello, the pop encyclopedia, can reinvent the past in his own image\".\n\nHis prolific and varied 30-year career has been marked by two constants: sharp songwriting and musical restlessness. The latter has seen him dabble in almost every musical form, from country to jazz to orchestral. This stems from the fact that, at heart, Costello is a fan. His desire to work with his musical heroes has attracted collaborators as diverse as Burt Bacharach and Paul McCartney, Anne Sofie von Otter, Allen Toussaint, Aimee Mann, Bill Frisell, and Brian Eno.\n\nBut his most successful partners were his long-term band The Attractions. They comprised Steve Nieve (keyboards), Pete Thomas (drums) and Bruce Thomas (bass). Between 1978 and 1983, this outfit produced a peerless series of albums: This Year's Model; Armed Forces; Get Happy!!; Almost Blue; Trust; Imperial Bedroom and Punch the Clock. \n\nThese recordings drew on styles spanning soul, country and western and commercial pop. It was only with 1984's Goodbye Cruel World that Costello started to stumble. An album he concedes was one of his worst, it ushered in a period which produced interesting music but lacked the consistent quality of his halcyon days. Interestingly, although he enlisted the other Elvis's band for King of America in 1986, it was a reunion with The Attractions and former producer Nick Lowe that produced his best album of the late 1980s in the form of the scabrous Blood and Chocolate.\n\nThe following albums, Spike and Mighty Like a Rose were uncompromising and difficult solo works, as was the string quartet collaboration The Juliet Letters in 1993. It was only reconvening the Attractions for Brutal Youth the following year that gave his fans another glimpse of what first attracted them to him: punchy, angry pop songs, tightly played by an impeccably taut ensemble.\n\nSince then, Costello has become a career dilettante, true to his inner musical quest, but never again returning to heights he scaled in the early 1980s. Maybe the best work of this latter period was 1998's Painted from Memory. This joint effort with Burt Bacharach matched restrained writing from Costello with stately Bacharach arrangements.\n\nSubsequent career nadirs such as the tune-free North (2003), and instrumental orchestral works such as Il Sogno (2004) led many long-term admirers to conclude that Costello had retained his integrity at the expense of his real musical strengths. However, he has given occasional evidence of his former fire. The ballsy bar-room atmosphere of the collaborative The Delivery Man (2004), suggests that he is still capable of giving his fans what they want, in between his more esoteric experiments. \n\nElvis is married to jazz vocalist Diana Krall and they have twin sons.\n\n*Upon the film's release, it was noted that the name \"Napoleon Dynamite\" had originally been used by musician Elvis Costello, most visibly on his 1986 album Blood and Chocolate, although he had used the pseudonym on a single B-side as early as 1982. Filmmaker Jared Hess claims that he was not aware of Costello's use of the name until two days before the end of shooting, when he was informed by a teenage extra. He later said, \"Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film, it definitely would have been changed ... I listen to hip-hop, dude. It's a pretty embarrassing coincidence.\" Hess claims that \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was the name of a man he met around the year 2000 on the streets of Cicero, Illinois while doing missionary work for the Mormon Church.\n\nCostello believes that Hess stole the name: \"The guy just denies completely that I made the name up... but I invented it. Maybe somebody told him the name and he truly feels that he came about it by chance. But it's two words that you're never going to hear together.\" To date, Costello has taken no legal action against the film.\n\n Elvis Costello and Elton John to Make a Television 'Spectacle'\n\nTwo of the most respected musicians in the world will collaborate on an extraordinary new television series.\n\n\"Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...\" is hosted by its namesake and produced in conjunction with Sir Elton John's Rocket Pictures. Elton John will be one of the program's Executive Producers.\n\nThe series begain airing in 2008 on CTV in Canada, Channel 4 in the UK and Sundance Channel in the US. FremantleMedia Enterprises, will handle sales of the show to the rest of the world.\n\nConceived to provide a forum for in-depth discussion and performance with the most interesting and influential artists and personalities of our time, the show fuses the best of talk and music television.\n\n\"Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...\" is an unpredictable and unprecedented television experience. The series of 13 one-hour programs features everything from intimate one-on-ones with legendary performers and notable newcomers to thematic panel discussions, with a variety of performance elements including unique collaborations, acoustic and impromptu \"illustrative\" demonstrations of the creative process, and some original interpretations of others' songs by Costello.

  "Elvis Presley": {
    "bio": "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\".\n\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial.\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate, just 42 years of age.\n\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

  "Etta James": {
    "bio": "Etta James (1938-2012) was a U.S.  blues, soul, R&B, rock & roll, and jazz singer and songwriter. She is the winner of four Grammies, seventeen Blues Music Awards, and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (in 1993), the Blues Hall of Fame (in 2001), and the Grammy Hall of Fame (in both 1999 and 2008).\n\nJames was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles, California, on 25th January 1938, to an unmarried fourteen-year-old mother, Dorothy Hawkins. According to Etta, her mother claimed that her father was the white Rudolph  \"Minnesota Fats\" Wanderone, and that they received financial support from him on the condition that they keep his paternity a secret. This seems unlikely, though it has not been definitively disproved. Etta was born in Los Angeles in 1938. At the time, Wanderone was known to be managing a pool hall in Washington, D.C. and had not yet become known to be the cross-country traveller he later became. \n\nShe received her first professional vocal training at five years old from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at St Paul Baptist Church in Los Angeles.  Her family moved to San Francisco in 1950, and she teamed up with two other girls to form a doo-wop singing group. When the girls were fourteen, band leader Johnny Otis had them audition. They sang an answer to Hank Ballard's \"Work with Me, Annie\" called \"Roll Wwth Me Henry\".  Otis particularly liked the song, and against her mother's wishes, James and the trio went to Los Angeles to record the song in 1954. The song was recorded on the label Modern Records. By this time, the trio renamed the song \"The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)\" and released it in 1955. James named her vocal group The Peaches. Richard Berry, a Los Angeles doo-wop luminary, is featured on some of their records.\n\n\"The Wallflower\" reached number two on the rhythm and blues charts in February 1955, but was undercut in the wider market by a rushed-out cover version by Georgia Gibbs on Mercury Records; in fact, the very first time Gibbs was recorded in studio, they used the first take recorded and it became number one on the top 100 songs nationally. The song's royalties were divided between Hank Ballard, Etta James, and Johnny Otis, and its huge success attracted the attention of the R&B world, resulting in James going on tour with Little Richard. On the tour, though, according to James, she witnessed and experienced situations to which minors are not usually privy, and she allegedly acquired a drug habit.\n\nSoon after the success of \"Wallflower\", The Peaches and James parted company, but this did not halt her career. Shecontinued to record and release albums throughout much of the decade, and enjoyed more success. Her follow-up, \"Good Rockin' Daddy\", became another fifties hit. Other songs however, such as \"Tough Lover\" and \"W-O-M-A-N\" failed to gain any significant success. James toured with Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson and Otis Redding in the fifties, and has cited Watson as the most significant influence on her style..\n\nIn 1960, James signed a recording contract with Chess Records. She went on to have the biggest success of her career from this label, recording her biggest and most memorable hits. Chess went into high gear with James, releasing many duets with her then boyfriend, the married Harvey Fuqua, who was the lead singer of the Moonglows. One of her duets with Fuqua, \"If I Can't Have You\", became a hit on the R&B charts in 1960. As a solo artist however, she had more enduring success. One of her first singles released by Chess in 1960 was called \"All I Could Do Was Cry\"; this blues number became a big hit on the R&B charts in 1960. Leonard Chess, one of the founders of Chess Records, helped James along the way. He saw the potential for her to go in a more pop-oriented direction, and she started recording more pop tunes for the label.\n\nThe year 1961 became a year of great change for James. In 1961 came the release of one of her first pop-oriented tunes called \"At Last\". The song became a big hit in 1961, reaching number two on the R&B charts. The song even went as far as twenty-two on the pop charts that year. It became her signature song. Other songs, such as \"Trust in Me\", also became hits, and the 1962 tune \"Something's Got a Hold On Me\" showed more of James' gospel side, a genre she had sung since childhood.\n\nShe had other big hits in the 1960s, but mainly on the R&B charts: the song \"Pushover\" in 1963 and \"Stop the Wedding\", \"Fool That I Am\", and \"Don't Cry Baby\", were hits for her between 1961 and 1963. Her 1963 album Etta James Rocks the House, recorded at Nashville's \"New Era\" club, also gave her career a boost. James then became one of the most successful R&B artists of the 1960s, having many more top ten and top twenty hit singles. Performing in Memphis, Tennessee helped make her into a blues icon.\n\nIn 1967, James released her next hit single, \"Tell Mama\", and it became a top ten hit on the R&B charts. After a dry period of no hits for almost four years, the song once more made James a household name. The follow-up, \"Security\", was also a success, and proved that James had staying power on the charts again. Whilst less success came for James after this hit, she was still on the charts regularly and, despite the death of Leonard Chess, stayed with the Chess label into 1975. Towards the end of the Chess years though, she went into more rock-based songs. She recorded for many other labels, and continued to release albums, such as 1978's Deep In the Night on Atlantic Records.\n\nDespite a dry period during the early to mid 1980s, James got back on track and began to record music again. She received accolades for her 1981 rendition of Randy Newman's \"God's Song\". Her 1988 album Seven Year Itch proved this comeback capability; the album showed more of her soul side. In 1989, she recorded the song \"Avenue D\" with David A. Stewart of Eurythmics. The song was featured on the soundtrack to the Robert Wise film Rooftops. She also performed with the Grateful Dead for two shows in 1982. In the 1990s she continued to record and perform. Her albums widely varied in styles and genres. Her 1992 album, The Right Time, was another soul album that was released by Elektra Records. She also began to record more jazz, which became the style for many of her 1990s albums.\n\nDrug-related and romantic problems interfered with her career, but James managed to maintain a career throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. Later in life, she struggled with obesity, experiencing mobility and knee problems.  In 2003, she underwent gastric bypass surgery.\n\nIn 2011, a vocal sample from Etta's \"Something's Got a Hold on Me\" was used in \"Levels\" by Avicii.  \"Levels\" became a monster EDM hit, making Etta's \"sometimes I get a good feeling\" one of the most recognizable samples in 21st century music.  It was used again in the 2020 hit \"Good Feeling\"  by Flo Rida, with songwriting credit shared to both Etta and Avicii.\n\nShe died on 20th January 2012.

  "Everly Brothers": {
    "bio": "The Everly Brothers was an American country-influenced rock and roll duo, known for steel-string acoustic guitar playing and close harmony singing. Consisting of Isaac Donald \"Don\" Everly (February 1, 1937 – August 21, 2021) and Phillip \"Phil\" Everly (January 19, 1939 – January 3, 2014), the duo was raised in a musical family, first appearing on radio singing along with their father Ike Everly and mother Margaret Everly as \"The Everly Family\" in the 1940s. When the brothers were still in high school, they gained the attention of prominent Nashville musicians like Chet Atkins, who began to promote them for national attention.\n\nThey began writing and recording their own music in 1956, and their first hit song came in 1957, with \"Bye Bye Love\", written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant. The song hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957, and additional hits would follow through 1958, many of them written by the Bryants, including \"Wake Up Little Susie\", \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", and \"Problems\". In 1960, they signed with the major label Warner Bros. Records and recorded \"Cathy's Clown\", written by the brothers themselves, which was their biggest selling single. The brothers enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1961, and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962, with \"That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)\" being their last top-10 hit.\n\nLong-simmering disputes with Wesley Rose, the CEO of Acuff-Rose Music, which managed the group, a growing drug usage in the 1960s, as well as changing tastes in popular music, led to the group's decline in popularity in its native U.S., though the brothers continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada, and had many highly successful tours throughout the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings, and in 1973 they officially broke up. Starting in 1983, the brothers got back together, and would continue to perform periodically until Phil's death in 2014. Don died seven years later.\n\nThe group was highly influential on the music of the generation that followed it. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers, including the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Bee Gees, and Simon & Garfunkel. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked the Everly Brothers No. 1 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class of 1986, and into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Don was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019, earning the organization's first Iconic Riff Award for his distinctive rhythm guitar intro to the Everlys' massive 1957 hit \"Wake Up Little Susie\".\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Everly_Brothers User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.\nabian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.\nWith songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including \"I'm a Man\", \"Hound Dog Man\", a #9 hit in the U.S., \"Turn Me Loose\" (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, \"Tiger\", which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included \"String Along\", \"About This Thing Called Love\" and \"This Friendly World\", which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.\nHis career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox.

He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked.

  "Frank Sinatra": {
    "bio": "Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. \n\nBorn in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of The Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958) and Nice 'n' Easy (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and released the tracks \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\". After releasing Sinatra at the Sands, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's collaboration with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and reached success in 1980 with \"New York, New York\". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until a short time before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for From Here to Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.\n\nWhile Sinatra never formally learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.\n\nSinatra died with his wife at his side at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 14, 1998, aged 82, after a heart attack. Sinatra had ill health during the last few years of his life, and was frequently hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia and bladder cancer. He was further diagnosed as having dementia. He had made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. Sinatra's wife encouraged him to \"fight\" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and his final words were, \"I'm losing.\" Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her sister, Nancy, had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that \"the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband's side.\" The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building in New York City were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for a minute.\n\nSinatra's funeral was held at the Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in attendance and thousands of fans outside. Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra's son, Frank Jr., addressed the mourners, who included many notable people from film and entertainment. Sinatra was buried in a blue business suit with mementos from family members—cherry-flavored Life Savers, Tootsie Rolls, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, stuffed toys, a dog biscuit, and a roll of dimes that he always carried—next to his parents in section B-8 of Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\n\nHis close friends Jilly Rizzo and Jimmy Van Heusen are buried nearby. The words \"The Best Is Yet to Come\", plus \"Beloved Husband & Father\" are imprinted on Sinatra's grave marker. Significant increases in recording sales worldwide were reported by Billboard in the month of his death.

    "bio": "Frankie Ford (August 4, 1939 – September 28, 2015), was an American rock and roll and rhythm and blues singer, best known for his 1959 hit \"Sea Cruise\".\n\nHe was born in Gretna, Louisiana, as Vincent Francis Guzzo, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, and was the adopted son of Vincent and Anna Guzzo, who named him Vincent Francis Guzzo, Jr. He learned to sing and dance at an early age, and when at high school joined a group, the Syncopators, as singer and pianist. He was spotted by manager Joe Caronna, who took him to Johnny Vincent of Ace Records. Taking the stage name Frankie Ford, he made his first recordings for Ace in 1958. He toured locally in Louisiana, before recording a vocal overdub on the song \"Sea Cruise\", a song written and originally recorded by Huey \"Piano\" Smith with his group, the Clowns, and featuring overdubbed bells and ships' horns.. As Smith already had a record in the charts, and was away touring, the record label decided to release Ford's version, and it rose to #14 on the US pop chart and #11 on the R&B chart, selling over one million copies, and gaining gold disc status.\n\nFord toured widely around the US, but his later records were less successful, with his versions of \"Alimony\" and \"Time After Time\" only reaching the lower reaches of the national charts. He also recorded a novelty record in praise of a local TV presenter, \"Morgus the Magnificent\", with musicians including Mac Rebennack and Jerry Byrne, but it failed to sell. Ace released an LP by Ford, Let's Take A Sea Cruise With Frankie Ford, before the singer moved to Imperial Records in late 1960. He recorded with producer Dave Bartholomew, and released a version of \"You Talk Too Much\", but Ford's recording missed out in competition with one by Joe Jones which was issued almost simultaneously. In 1961, his version of Boyd Bennett's 1955 hit \"Seventeen\" was Ford's last chart entry.\n\nFord was drafted in 1962, and performed for troops in Japan, Vietnam and Korea. He later recorded occasionally for small labels, but mainly performed in clubs in and around New Orleans. He appeared in the 1978 movie American Hot Wax, and toured in Britain and Europe, recording the album New Orleans Dynamo in London in 1984. He continued to record and perform through the 1990s. Ford co-owned the Briarmeade record label, which issued several singles and albums by him from the 1970s to the 2000s. On May 16, 2010, at the Louisiana Music Homecoming in Erwinville, Ford was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.\n\nFord died in Gretna at the age of 76 on September 28, 2015, following a long illness.

  "Gary Stewart": {
    "bio": "Gary Stewart (May 28, 1944 – December 16, 2003), a country musician known for his drinking songs, was one of the first so-called \"outlaw\" country performers of the 1970s.\n\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist, he was born in the Letcher County, Kentucky town of Jenkins, the son of a coal miner. In 1958 his father sustained an injury while working in the mines, and shortly after the family moved to Fort Pierce, a city on Florida's Atlantic coast.\n\nStewart began recording at twelve, moved on to songwriting, and married Mary Lou Taylor when he was eighteen. While playing a Honky-Tonk club in Okeechobee, Florida, known as the Wagon Wheel, he met country singer Mel Tillis, who advised Stewart to travel to Nashville to pitch his songs. He recorded songs for the small Cory label in 1964. In Nashville, Jerry Bradley, the son of record-producer Owen Bradley, worked with Stewart and collaborator Bill Eldridge to refine their songs, and in 1965 Stonewall Jackson's recording of their \"Poor Red Georgia Dirt\" made the country charts.\n\nSigned to the Kapp label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings. But Carl Smith, Billy Walker and Nat Stuckey had hits with Stewart's songs. Dropped from Kapp and then from Decca, Stewart made a series of demo tapes that found their way into the hands of producer Roy Dea, who signed Stewart to RCA Records. Their collaboration produced the hits \"Drinkin' Thing,\" \"Out of Hand\" and \"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles),\" the latter which was his only number-one song. Other hits from this most commercially successful period of Stewart's career (1974-1977) include \"Flat Born Natural Good Timin' Man,\" \"In Some Room Above the Street\" and \"Your Place or Mine.\" Through this time during the seventies and into the eighties, Gary played with a group named Aberdeen Rockfish Railroad, or as Gary called them the Honky Tonk Liberation Army. This band which consisted of Donnie Coleman, Chris Casses, Bob Melton, Darrell Dawson, Howie Folcarelli, and Ralph Profetta travelled and played with him. They also sang backup on several of Stewart's RCA releases, including \"Easy People\", \"Can't You See\", \"Pretend I Never Happened\", and played behind him on several unreleased songs recorded at Bradley's Barn. They were nominated for Instrumental Group of The Year by Country Music Magazine and were the driving force behind Stewart's signature raucous live sound. Stewart's recordings are characterized by his barely controlled vocals, rock-and-roll-like instrumentation, and a classicism that recalls both the country music and the rockabilly of the 1950s.\n\nBy the late 1970s Stewart no longer sold records in the quantities of a few years before, but many critics rank recordings from this era, such as \"Single Again,\" as among his best work. He recorded an album with producer Chips Moman in 1980, Cactus and a Rose, and left RCA for the Hightone label, where he recorded Brand New in 1988. Drug and alcohol problems plagued him in the '80s, and his son, Gary Joseph Stewart, committed suicide late in the decade.\n\nDespite these hardships, Stewart and his wife continued to tour the honky tonk circuit through the 1990s, playing venues such as Fort Worth's Billy Bob's Texas several times a year.\n\nIn 2003, Stewart released a live album, Live at Billy Bob's Texas. But on November 26, the day before Thanksgiving, his wife died of pneumonia. They had been married forty years.\n\nStewart, who had been scheduled to play Billy Bob's three days later, cancelled his concert appearances. His friends later told reporters that he was extremely despondent after Mary Lou's death. On December 16, his daughter's boyfriend and Stewart's very close friend Bill Hardman visited Stewart's Fort Pierce, Florida home to check on his welfare. Gary Stewart was dead, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck.\n\nWriter Jim Lewis summed up Stewart thus: \"Stewart really didn't fit in anywhere. He wasn't Southern rock, and he wasn't Nashville country.\" Still, Stewart's work has gained in critical esteem since the '70s. As music critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"...he's the equal of any postoutlaw you care to name except maybe John Anderson.\" User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",
    "bioSummary": "Gary Stewart (May 28, 1944 – December 16, 2003), a country musician known for his drinking songs, was one of the first so-called \"outlaw\" country performers of the 1970s.\n\nA singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist, he was born in the Letcher County, Kentucky town of Jenkins, the son of a coal miner. In 1958 his father sustained an injury while working in the mines, and shortly after the family moved to Fort Pierce, a city on Florida's Atlantic coast. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gary+Stewart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

  "Gary U.S. Bonds": {
    "bio": "Gary \"U.S.\" Bonds (born Gary Anderson, 6 June 1939) is an American rhythm and blues and rock 'n' roll singer. He is also a prolific songwriter.\n\nBorn in Jacksonville, Florida, Bonds was living in Norfolk, Virginia in the 1950's when he began singing publicly in church, and with a group called The Turks. He joined record producer Frank Guida's small Legrand label and Guida changed his name to U.S. Bonds in hopes that it would be confused with a public service announcement advertising the sale of government bonds and thus get more airtime. Bonds' first hit was the song \"New Orleans\", which was followed by \"Not Me\", a flop for Bonds, but later a hit for The Orlons, and then by his only Number One hit, \"Quarter To Three\" in June 1961. Subsequent hits, under the name Gary (U.S.) Bonds, included \"School Is Out\", \"Dear Lady Twist\" and \"Twist, Twist, Senora\" in the early 1960s. In a 1963 tour of Europe, he headlined above The Beatles. Eventually, the singer came to be known as Gary U.S. Bonds.\n\n\"Quarter To Three\" appears on The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Bonds had a career resurgence, working off collaborations with Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, and the E Street Band. Later hits included \"This Little Girl\", \"Jolé Blon\" and \"Out Of Work\". Bonds continues to release albums sporadically, and today is a mainstay of the nostalgia concert circuit.\n\nWhile Gary U.S. Bonds is mostly known for achievements within Rhythm and Blues and Rock 'n' roll, he often transcends these genres, e.g. he has been nominated for the Country Music Association's \"Songwriter of the Year\" distinction. He is also a honoree of the Rhythm & Blues Foundation. Bonds is an accomplished golfer and often plays celebrity PGA events.\n\nHe was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on Oct 15, 2006.

  "George Jones": {
    "bio": "George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 – April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\", as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last two decades of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song \"It's Alright\": \"If we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones.\" The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname \"The Possum\".\n\nBorn in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven, and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones recorded \"White Lightning\", written by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones\". After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became sober for good in 1999. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure.\n\nGeorge Jones has been called \"The Rolls Royce Of Country Music\" and had more than 160 chart singles to his name from 1955 until his death in 2013. Johnny Cash once said, \"When people ask me who my favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'\"\n\nJones tirelessly defended the integrity of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, \"It's never been for love of money. I thank God for it because it makes me a living. But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.\" Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. \"Everybody knows he's a great singer,\" Alan Jackson stated in 1995, \"but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!\"\n\nShortly after Jones' death, Andrew Mueller wrote about his influence in Uncut, \"He was one of the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphone...There cannot be a single country songwriter of the last 50-odd years who has not wondered what it might be like to hear their words sung by that voice.\" In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer's vocal style: \"While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon.\" In the New Republic essay \"Why George Jones ranks with Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday,\" David Hajdu writes:\n\n\"Jones had a handsome and strange voice. His singing was always partly about the appeal of the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang from the back of his throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful.\"\n\nDavid Cantwell recalled in 2013, \"His approach to singing, he told me once, was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He was a kind of singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real.\" In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, \"Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish\". In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, \"Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it.\" In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, \"His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: one of the greatest instruments ever made.\" Emmylou Harris wrote, \"when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always,\" a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Randy Travis: \"It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that\"; Tom T. Hall: \"It was always Jones who got the message across just right\"; and Roy Acuff: \"I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones\". In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, \"All I did was change the instrumentation around him. I don't think he's changed at all.\"\n\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed George Jones among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

  "Glen Campbell": {
    "bio": "Glen Travis Campbell (April 22, 1936 – August 8, 2017) was an American rock and country music singer, musician, songwriter, television host and actor. He is known for a series of hits in the 1960s and 1970s, and for hosting a music and comedy variety show called The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour on CBS television from January 1969 through June 1972.\n\nDuring his 50 years in show business, Campbell released more than 70 albums. He sold 45 million records and accumulated 12 RIAA Gold albums, four Platinum albums and one Double-platinum album. He placed a total of 80 different songs on either the Billboard Country Chart, Billboard Hot 100, or the Adult Contemporary Chart, of which 29 made the top 10 and of which nine reached number one on at least one of those charts. Campbell's hits include his recordings of John Hartford's \"Gentle on My Mind\"; Jimmy Webb's \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"Wichita Lineman\" and \"Galveston\"; Larry Weiss's \"Rhinestone Cowboy\"; and Allen Toussaint's \"Southern Nights\".\n\nCampbell made history in 1967 by winning four Grammys total in the country and pop categories. For \"Gentle on My Mind\", he received two awards in country and western, \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" did the same in pop. Three of his early hits later won Grammy Hall of Fame Awards (2000, 2004, 2008), while Campbell himself won the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He owns trophies for Male Vocalist of the Year from both the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM), and took the CMA's top award as 1968 Entertainer of the Year. Campbell appeared in the film True Grit, which gave him a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. Campbell sang the title song which was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nGlen Travis Campbell was born in Billstown, Arkansas, to John Wesley and Carrie Dell (Stone) Campbell. He was the seventh son of 12 children.  He started playing guitar as a youth and credits his uncle Boo for teaching him the guitar.\n\nIn 1954, Campbell moved to Albuquerque to join his uncle's band known as Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys. He also appeared there on his uncle's radio show and on K Circle B Time, the local children's program on KOB television. In 1958, Campbell formed his own band, the Western Wranglers.\n\nIn 1960, Campbell moved to Los Angeles to become a session musician. In October 1960 he joined The Champs. By January 1961, Campbell had found a daytime job at publishing company American Music, writing songs and recording demos. Because of these demos Campbell soon was in demand as a session musician and became part of a group of studio musicians later known as The Wrecking Crew. Campbell played on recordings by Bobby Darin, Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, The Monkees, Nancy Sinatra, Merle Haggard, Jan and Dean, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Phil Spector.\n\nIn May 1961, he left The Champs and was subsequently signed by Crest Records, a subsidiary of American Music. His first solo release, \"Turn Around, Look at Me\", was a moderate success, peaking at number 62 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. Campbell also formed The Gee Cees with former bandmembers from The Champs, performing at The Crossbow Inn in Van Nuys. The Gee Cees, too, released a single on Crest, the instrumental \"Buzz Saw\", which did not chart.\n\nIn 1962, Campbell signed with Capitol Records. After minor initial success with \"Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry\", his first single for the label, and \"Kentucky Means Paradise\", released by The Green River Boys featuring Glen Campbell, a string of unsuccessful singles and albums followed.\n\nFrom 1964 on, Campbell began to appear on television as a regular on Star Route, a syndicated series hosted by Rod Cameron,[18] ABC's Shindig!, and Hollywood Jamboree.\n\nFrom December 1964 to early March 1965, Campbell was a touring member of The Beach Boys, filling in for Brian Wilson. He also played guitar on the band's Pet Sounds (1966) album, among other recordings. On tour, he played bass guitar and sang falsetto harmonies. In April 1966, he joined Ricky Nelson on a tour through the Far East, again playing bass.\n\nIn 1965, he had his biggest solo hit yet, reaching number 45 on the Hot 100 with a version of Buffy Sainte-Marie's \"Universal Soldier\". Asked about the pacifist message of the song, he elected to assert that \"people who are advocating burning draft cards should be hung.\"\n\nWhen follow-up singles did not do well, and Capitol was considering dropping Campbell from the label in 1966, he was teamed with producer Al De Lory. Together, they first collaborated on \"Burning Bridges\" which became a top 20 country hit in early 1967, and the album of the same name. Campbell and De Lory collaborated again on 1967's \"Gentle on My Mind\", written by John Hartford, which was an overnight success. The song was followed by the bigger hit \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" later in 1967, and \"I Wanna Live\" and \"Wichita Lineman\" in 1968. Campbell won four Grammy Awards for his performances on \"Gentle on My Mind\" and \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\".\n\nIn 1967, Campbell was also the uncredited lead vocalist on \"My World Fell Down\" by Sagittarius, a studio group. The song reached number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe 1969 song \"True Grit\" by composer Elmer Bernstein and lyricist Don Black, and sung by Campbell, who co-starred in the movie, received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song and the Golden Globe for Best Original Song.\n\nHis biggest hits in the late 1960s were the songs written by Jimmy Webb: \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"Wichita Lineman\", \"Galveston\", and \"Where's the Playground Susie\". An album of mainly Webb-penned compositions, Reunion: The Songs of Jimmy Webb, was released in 1974, but it produced no hit single records. \"Wichita Lineman\" (1968) was selected as one of the greatest songs of the 20th century by Mojo magazine in 1997 and by Blender in 2001.\n\nAfter he hosted a 1968 summer replacement for television's The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour variety show, Campbell hosted his own weekly variety show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, from January 1969 through June 1972. At the height of his popularity, a 1970 biography by Freda Kramer, The Glen Campbell Story, was published.\n\nWith Campbell's session-work connections, he hosted major names in music on his show, including The Beatles (on film), David Gates, Bread, The Monkees, Neil Diamond, Linda Ronstadt, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Roger Miller, and Mel Tillis. Campbell helped launch the careers of Anne Murray and Jerry Reed, who were regulars on his Goodtime Hour program.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, Campbell released a long series of singles and appeared in the movies True Grit (1969) with John Wayne and Kim Darby and Norwood (1970) with Kim Darby and Joe Namath.\n\nAfter the cancellation of his CBS series in 1972, Campbell remained a regular on network television. He co-starred in a made-for-television movie, Strange Homecoming (1974), with Robert Culp and up-and-coming teen idol, Leif Garrett. He hosted a number of television specials, including 1976's Down Home, Down Under with Olivia Newton-John. He co-hosted the American Music Awards from 1976–78 and headlined the 1979 NBC special Glen Campbell: Back to Basics with guest-stars Seals and Crofts and Brenda Lee. \n\nIn the mid-1970s, he had more hits with \"Rhinestone Cowboy\", \"Southern Nights\" (both U.S. number one hits), \"Sunflower\" (U.S. number 39) (written by Neil Diamond), and \"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L.A.)\" (U.S. number 11).\n\n\"Rhinestone Cowboy\" was Campbell's largest-selling single, initially with over 2 million copies sold. Campbell had heard songwriter Larry Weiss' version while on tour of Australia in 1974. Both songs were in the October 4, 1975 Hot 100 top 10. Campbell also made a techno/pop version of the song in 2002 with UK artists Rikki & Daz and went to the top 10 in the UK with the dance version and related music video.\n\n\"Southern Nights\", by Allen Toussaint, his other number one pop-rock-country crossover hit, was generated with the help of Jimmy Webb, and Jerry Reed, who inspired the famous guitar lick introduction to the song, which was the most-played jukebox number of 1977.\n\nCampbell made a cameo appearance in the 1980 Clint Eastwood movie Any Which Way You Can, for which he recorded the title song. In 1991, he provided the voice of the Elvis Presley sound-alike rooster Chanticleer in the Don Bluth film Rock-a-Doodle. He gave up smoking on March 15, 1992, and believed his singing voice improved as a result. In 1999, Campbell was featured on VH-1's Behind the Music, A&E Network's Biography in 2001, and on a number of CMT programs. Campbell ranked 29th on CMT's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003. \n\nIn 2005, Campbell was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.[29] It was announced in April 2008 that Campbell was returning to his signature label, Capitol, to release his new album, Meet Glen Campbell. The album was released on August 19. With this album, he branched off in a different musical direction, covering tracks from artists such as Travis, U2, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Jackson Browne, and Foo Fighters. It was Campbell's first release on Capitol in over 15 years. Musicians from Cheap Trick and Jellyfish contributed to the album, as well. The first single, a cover of Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", was released to radio in July 2008.\n\nIn March 2010, a then-farewell album titled Ghost on the Canvas was announced which served as a companion to Meet Glen Campbell (2008).

    "bio": "Gregory LeNoir \"Gregg\" Allman (December 8, 1947 – May 27, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter.\n\nHe is best known for performing in The Allman Brothers Band. He was born and spent much of his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee, before relocating to Daytona Beach, Florida. He and his brother, Duane Allman, developed an interest in music in their teens, and began performing in the Allman Joys in the mid-1960s. In 1967, they relocated to Los Angeles and were renamed the Hour Glass, releasing two albums for Liberty Records. In 1969, he and Duane regrouped to form the Allman Brothers Band, which settled in Macon, Georgia.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band began to reach mainstream success by the early 1970s, with their live album At Fillmore East representing a commercial and artistic breakthrough. Shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1971. The following year, the band's bassist, Berry Oakley was also killed in a motorcycle accident very close to the location of Duane's wreck. Their 1973 album Brothers and Sisters became their biggest hit, and Allman pursued a solo career afterward, releasing his debut album, Laid Back the same year. Internal turmoil took over the group, leading to a 1975 breakup. Allman was married to pop star Cher for the rest of the decade, while he continued his solo career with the Gregg Allman Band. After a brief Allman Brothers reunion and a decade of little activity, he reached an unexpected peak with the hit single \"I'm No Angel\" in 1987. After two more solo albums, the Allman Brothers reformed for a third and final time in 1989, and continued performing until 2014. He released his most recent solo album, Low Country Blues, in 2011, and his next, Southern Blood, is set to be released in 2017.\n\nFor his work in music, Allman was referred to as a Southern rock pioneer and received numerous awards, including several Grammys; he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. His distinctive voice placed him in 70th place in the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". Allman released an autobiography, My Cross to Bear, in 2012.\nAllman died in Savannah, Georgia, on May 27, 2017.

    "bio": "Heart is an American rock band formed in 1970 in Seattle, Washington, by Steve Fossen (bass guitar), Roger Fisher (guitar), David Belzer (keyboards), and Jeff Johnson (drums). It evolved from an existing band, White Heart. The vocalists for Heart are sisters Ann Wilson (lead vocals, flute, guitar) (born June 19, 1950) and Nancy Wilson (vocals, guitar, mandolin) (born March 16, 1954).\n\nHeart rose to fame in the mid-to-late-1970s with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, as well as folk music. The band's popularity declined in the early 1980s, but it began a successful comeback in 1985 which continued into the mid-1990s. Heart disbanded in 1998, resumed performing in 2002, went on hiatus in 2016, and resumed performing in the summer of 2019. Heart's U.S. Top 40 singles include \"Magic Man\" (1975), \"Crazy on You\" (1976), \"Barracuda\" (1977), \"What About Love\" (1985), \"Never\" (1985), and \"All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You\" (1990), along with no. 1 hits \"These Dreams\" (1986) and \"Alone\" (1987).\n\nHeart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, including approximately 22.5 million albums in the United States.

In 2013, Heart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2011, Heart earned its first nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the 2012 class. After being passed over, the band was nominated again the following year announced as inductees to the 2013 class on December 11, 2012. Their Hall of Fame page describes the Wilson sisters as the first women to front a hard-rock band, and \"pioneers ... inspiring women to pick up an electric guitar or start a band\".\n\nIn his book Heart: In the Studio, Jake Brown described the band as beginning \"a revolution for women in music ... breaking genre barriers and garnering critical acclaim\".\n\n\"Heart were the first female-fronted band I heard and was influenced by,\" recalled Lzzy Hale of Halestorm. \"I heard Heart and was like, 'Oh, singing like that as a girl is actually a thing!'\"\n\nThe Wilson sisters have been active in the Seattle music scene for decades and influenced many musicians from the region, including bands of the grunge era. Artists that have used their Bad Animals Studio include Neil Young, R.E.M., Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.\n\nThere are multiple artists tracked as \"Heart\" on last.fm. The following are listed in order of prominence.\n\n1. HeaRt are a Japanese rock band.\n\nThey are a group made up from old members of the LOOP ASH band, JOKER who formed officially on the 7/7/05.

  "Hurray For The Riff Raff": {
    "bio": "Hurray for the Riff Raff is an Americana band from New Orleans, Louisiana. It was formed by Alynda Segarra, a Puerto Rican singer-songwriter from the Bronx, New York, after they had moved to New Orleans in 2007.\n\nAfter leaving home at an early age to travel the country, Segarra eventually settled in New Orleans where they began to perform and record with a revolving cast of musicians.  They released two records (2008's It Don't Mean I Don't Love You and 2010's Young Blood Blues) mostly consisting of delicate folk and country songs.  In 2011, the UK record label Loose Music (Felice Brothers, Dawes, Deer Tick), released Hurray for the Riff Raff, an album that collected the best songs from those records.  The Times of London named Hurray for the Riff Raff one of the Top Ten Albums of 2011.  Phil Alexander, the Editor-in-Chief of Mojo Magazine, raved that they “have immense potential and seductive power” and named them second best band at SXSW 2011.\n\nBack in the States, Alynda met up with a young honky-tonk band called the Tumbleweeds, just as they began to expand they musical palette to include rock n roll, pop, and soul.  In the tradition of Bob Dylan with Band and Neil Young with Crazy Horse, Alynda recruited the Tumbleweeds to be their touring band, drastically altering the sound of Hurray for the Riff Raff.\n\nLook Out Mama is the result of almost two years of Alynda and the Tumbleweeds criss-crossing the USA, playing over 100 shows in small bars and clubs.  Recorded in Nashville by producer Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes), Look Out Mama is an exploration of classic American music as interpreted by Alynda lee Segarra.  From the Swamp Pop of \"Little Black Star\" to the Classic Country of \"Look Out Mama\", to the Psychedelia of “Ode to John and Yoko” and even the Surf-Rock of “Lake of Fire”, Look Out Mama covers a wide array of musical ground, with every song unified by Alynda’s soulful vocals and expert songwriting.

That same year, the Indigo Girls released a six-track Extended play album named \"Indigo Girls\", and in 1987 released their first full-length album, Strange Fire, recorded at John Keane Studio in Athens, Georgia, and including \"Crazy Game\".

  "J.J. Cale": {
    "bio": "John Weldon Cale (5 December 1938 –  26 July  2013), known as JJ Cale or J.J. Cale, was a Grammy Award-winning American singer, musician, and songwriter. Cale was one of the originators of the Tulsa Sound, a loose genre drawing on blues, rockabilly, country, and jazz influences. Cale's personal style has often been described as \"laid back\".\n\nHis songs have been performed by a number of other musicians including \"After Midnight\" and \"Cocaine\" by Eric Clapton,\"Cajun Moon\" by Randy Crawford, \"Clyde\" and \"Louisiana Women\" by Waylon Jennings, \"Magnolia\" by Jai, \"Bringing It Back\" by Kansas, \"Call Me the Breeze\" and \"I Got the Same Old Blues\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, \"I'd Like to Love You, Baby\" by Tom Petty, \"Travelin' Light\" and \"Ride Me High\" by Widespread Panic, \"Tijuana\" by Harry Manx, \"Sensitive Kind\" by Carlos Santana, \"Cajun Moon\" by Herbie Mann with Cissy Houston, and \"Same Old Blues\" by Captain Beefheart.\n\nCale was born on December 5, 1938, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was raised in Tulsa and graduated from Tulsa Central High School in 1956. Along with a number of other young Tulsa musicians, Cale moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s, where he first worked as a studio engineer. \nThe Leathercoated Minds was a 1966-67 psychedelic studio-based band masterminded largely by Snuff Garrett and J J Cale. The band produced one album, A Trip down the Sunset Strip, co-produced by Cale and Garrett\n Finding little success as a recording artist, he later returned to Tulsa and was considering giving up the music business until Clapton recorded \"After Midnight\" in 1970. His first album, Naturally, established his style, described by Los Angeles Times writer Richard Cromelin as a \"unique hybrid of blues, folk and jazz, marked by relaxed grooves and Cale's fluid guitar and laconic vocals. His early use of drum machines and his unconventional mixes lend a distinctive and timeless quality to his work and set him apart from the pack of Americana roots-music purists.\"\n\nSome sources incorrectly give his real name as \"Jean-Jacques Cale\". In the 2006 documentary, To Tulsa and Back: On Tour with J.J. Cale, Cale talks about Elmer Valentine, co-owner of the Sunset Strip nightclub Whisky à GoGo, who employed him in the mid-1960s, being the one that came up with the \"JJ\" moniker to avoid confusion with the Velvet Underground's John Cale. Rocky Frisco tells the same version of the story mentioning the other John Cale but without further detail.\n\nHis biggest U.S. hit single, Crazy Mama, peaked at #22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1972. During the 2006 documentary film To Tulsa and Back Cale recounts the story of being offered the opportunity to appear on Dick Clark's American Bandstand to promote the song, which would have moved the song higher on the charts. Cale declined when told he could not bring his band to the taping and would be required to lip-sync the words to the song.\n\nCale died on Friday, July 26, 2013, at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla, California, after suffering a heart attack.

    "bio": "In 2004 Eric Clapton held a three day festival in Dallas, Texas, called The Crossroads Guitar Festival, which featured J.J. Cale. This gave Clapton the opportunity to ask Cale to produce an album for him. The two started working together and eventually decided to record together. A number of high profile musicians also agreed to work on the album, including Billy Preston, Pino Palladino, Derek Trucks, Taj Mahal, John Mayer, and Doyle Bramhall II.\n\nThe 14 track CD, entitled the Road to Escondido, was produced and recorded by the duo in August 2005 in California. The resulting music defies being labeled into any one category, but instead finds influence across the spectrum of blues, rock, country and folk. A hybrid sound that is unique musically, while still bearing the signature styles of Cale and Clapton recognized by fans around the world. The songs are warm and rich, with deep flowing rhythms, yet use an economy of words to express much.

He rose to prominence as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and, after that, as the guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather, two bands that are still active on and off. White is also a recording artist in his own right and under his own name.\n\nJack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song 'Portland Oregon'.  \n\nWhite's début solo single, 'Love Interruption', was made available on 30 January 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and on jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer’s preferred format, vinyl. Recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville it was paired with the exclusive non-LP B-side, 'Machine Gun Silhouette'. The single was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012.\n\nMore solo albums followed: Lazaretto (2014), Boarding House reach (2018), Fear of the Dawn (2022), Entering Heaven Alive (2022) and, perhaps his loudest rocking and most White Stripe-ish sounding solo album to date, No Name (2024).

  "Jackson Browne": {
    "bio": "Jackson Browne (born Clyde Jackson Browne; October 9, 1948) is an American singer and songwriter. First coming to prominence in the 70s, the rock musician has had a long career and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. \n\nBrowne was born in Heidelberg, Germany, where American serviceman father was stationed. Browne moved to the Highland Park district of Los Angeles, California at an early age and soon began singing folk music locally. In 1966, his major career began as a part of The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n \nOften mixing catchy melodies with reflective, moody, and sometimes melancholic lyrics, some of his most popular hit singles include \"Doctor My Eyes\", \"Running on Empty\", and \"Somebody's Baby\". Considered a precociously-talented songwriter by many peers, Browne's solo career got its legs when he signed a publishing contract with Nina Music. His work have been performed by several artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Joan Baez, Larry Norman, Linda Ronstadt, Nico, and Tom Rush, among many others.\n\nAfter moving to Greenwich Village, New York, Browne worked, for a brief period, in Tim Buckley's back-up band and on Nico's Chelsea Girl. This album includes two of Jackson's songs and the pair were reputedly lovers for awhile. After leaving New York City, Browne formed a folk band with Ned Doheny and Jack Wilce.\n\nIn 1971, Browne signed with Asylum Records and released Jackson Browne (1972), which included \"Doctor My Eyes\", a major hit and later coverec by the Jackson Five . He didn't sustain pop success, though, and his next album, For Everyman (1973), while considered of high quality, was a commercial failure.\n\nLate for the Sky (1974) established a significant audience for Browne, and fans and critics often consider this Browne's best album. Highlights include the searching title song, the elegiac \"For a Dancer\" and apocalyptic \"Before the Deluge\", the pure arrangements featuring David Lindley's evocative violin and guitar playing, and the Magritte-inspired cover. The title track was also featured in Martin Scorsese's film, Taxi Driver.\n\nBrowne released his breakthrough album, The Pretender (1976) soon after the suicide of his wife, Phyllis. Featuring livelier production by Jon Landau, the title song is a vividly described account of trying to maintain one's ideals in the struggle against the realities of day-to-day life.\n\nDuring this time, Browne produced and played on Warren Zevon's first two Asylum albums.\n\nBrowne began recording his next LP while on tour, and Running on Empty (1977) became his biggest commercial success. Breaking the usual conventions for a live album, it was truly made on the road, including tracks recorded on buses and in hotel rooms, with none of the songs having appeared on any of his prior albums. Running on Empty contains many renowned songs, such as the propulsive title track (Browne's biggest hit single), \"The Road\", \"Rosie\", and \"The Load-Out/Stay\" (Browne's affectionate and knowing send-off to his concert audiences).\n\nIn 1979, Browne was a founding member of Musicians United for Safe Energy.\n\nBrowne achieved less critical acclaim with Hold Out (1980), although it was commercially successful--his only number 1 record, and with his hit single \"Somebody's Baby\" from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack. Lawyers in Love followed in 1983 and contained hints of a more political focus, especially in the mysteriously satirical title track.\n\nPolitical protest came out full force in Lives in the Balance (1986), an overt condemnation of Reaganism and American policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with Browne fans, though not with mainstream audiences. World in Motion (1989) was even more politically-oriented and polarizing. Browne frequently played for causes he believed in, including Amnesty International (making several appearances on the 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope Tour), Farm Aid, and the Christic Institute.\n\nAfter four years of silence and a break-up with his girlfriend, actress Daryl Hannah, Browne returned with I'm Alive, a critically acclaimed album with a more personal perspective that sold respectably, the title track being a modest radio hit. Looking East (1996) was released soon after, but was not as successful critically or commercially. The Naked Ride Home was released in 2002. On 11 May 2003, Jackson Browne made a celebrity guest star debut on the FOX series The Simpsons.\n\nAs a whole, Browne's work is marked by compelling melodies, simple, honest, and insightful lyrics, and a flair for composition rarely seen in the world of rock and roll. He is often referred to as \"a thinking man's rock star.\"\n\nBrowne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. He also participated in the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org with the general goal of mobilizing people to vote in that year's Presidential campaign. Browne's appearances were joint performances with Bonnie Raitt and Keb' Mo', and in one instance with Bruce Springsteen. Three of Browne's albums were selected by Rolling Stone magazine as among its choices for the 500 best albums of all time.\n\nBrowne released \"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1\"in 2005 and \"Solo Acoustic, Vol. 2\" in 2008, both on Inside Recordings. The \"Vol. 1\" album consists of live recordings of eleven previously released tracks and \"The Birds of St. Marks,\" a song that does not appear on any of Browne's studio albums.  The \"Vol. 2\" album contains roughly the same mix of twelve songs (popular hits vs. deep cuts).  Interestingly, both albums also contain separately tracked \"intros\" to some songs, giving a brief glimpse of the intimacy between artist and audience at the shows where the songs were recorded.\n\n\"No one gives a shit but Jackson Browne.\" - Randy Newman in \"A Piece Of The Pie\"\n\nWebsite: www.jacksonbrowne.com User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

The I'm Your Puppet Songfacts states that after retiring, Dickey returned to his hometown of Tallahassee, Florida, in 1972 where he became a custodial crew supervisor at the Tallahassee Police Department.

(\"I'm Your Puppet\" was written and produced by Dan Penn, who introduced Purify and Moore.) The duo continued into the 1980s, with no other big hits, but remained popular on the tour circuit. When Purify faced legal problems (not career-related), Moore went solo, though still using the name \"Bobby Purify\" occasionally.

  "James Brown": {
    "bio": "James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American entertainer, record producer, and bandleader. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century music, he is often referred to by the honorific nicknames \"the Hardest Working Man in Show Business\", \"Godfather of Soul\", \"Mr. Dynamite\", and \"Soul Brother No. 1\". In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction in New York on January 23, 1986.\n\nBrown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He first came to national public attention in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads \"Please, Please, Please\" and \"Try Me\", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\".\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly \"Africanized\" approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" and \"The Payback\". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit \"Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud\". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.\n\nBrown recorded 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists.

  "James McMurtry": {
    "bio": "James McMurtry (born March 18, 1962 in Fort Worth, Texas) is a Texas rock/Texas Country singer, songwriter, guitarist, bandleader and occasional actor (Daisy Miller, Lonesome Dove). He performs as James McMurtry And The Heartless Bastards with veteran bandmates and rhythm section Darren Hess and Ronnie Johnson (not to be confused with the Cincinnati, OH, band Heartless Bastards).\n\nThe son of acclaimed author Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment), James grew up on a steady diet of Johnny Cash and Roy Acuff records. His first album, Too Long in the Wasteland (released in 1989), was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for his Longform Music Video of Where'd You Hide The Body. 1997's It Had To Happen received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.\n\nIn 2004, McMurtry released the universally-lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. 2005's Childish Things garnered some of the highest critical praise of McMurtry's career and spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and \"We Can't Make It Here\" won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008's Just Us Kids. This album marked his highest Billboard 200 chart position in more than 19 years.\n\nIn 2009, Live in Europe was released, capturing The McMurtry Band's first European tour and extraordinary live set. Along with seasoned band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, the disc features special guests Ian McLagan and Jon Dee Graham. Also, for the first time ever, video of the James McMurtry Band's live performance is available on the included DVD.\n\nThe poignant lyrics of his immense catalog still ring true today. In 2011, \"We Can't Make It Here\" was cited among 'The Nation's' \"Best Protest Songs Ever.\" Bob Lefsetz writes, \"'We Can't Make It Here' has stood the test of time because of its unmitigated truth.\"\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, James McMurtry continues to tour constantly, and consistently puts on a \"must-see\" powerhouse performance. 'The Washington Post' noted McMurtry's live prowess: \"Much attention is paid to James McMurtry's lyrics, and rightfully so: He creates a novel's worth of emotion and experience in four minutes of blisteringly stark couplets. What gets overlooked, however, is that he's an accomplished rock guitar player. At a sold-out Birchmere, the Austin-based artist was joined by drummer Daren Hess and bassist Ronnie Johnson in a set that demonstrated the raw power of wince-inducing imagery propelled by electric guitar. It was serious stuff, imparted by a singularly serious band.\"\n\nJAMES McMURTRY LIVE IN EUROPE CD WITH BONUS DVD DOCUMENTS FIRST EURO TOUR WITH GUESTS IAN MCLAGAN AND JON DEE GRAHAM\nOn October 13, 2009, Lightning Rod Records released Live in Europe, a document of McMurtry's first European tour, on which, along with long-time band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, he was joined by keyboardist Ian McLagan and fellow Texas songwriting legend Jon Dee Graham. The set is available as a CD with a bonus DVD, or as a deluxe vinyl LP package with a CD and DVD insert. In early 2009, James McMurtry and his trio traveled overseas to play their first European tour. The guys played for enthusiastic crowds in Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, The Netherlands, Scotland and Belgium. Joining the band on keyboards for the tour was the legendary Ian McLagan (who also played on McMurtry's latest studio album, Just Us Kids). The best recordings from the Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Geislingen, Germany concerts were combined to create Live in Europe. The album includes a bonus DVD featuring performances from the Amsterdam show. This marks the first time fans will be able to purchase video footage of McMurtry live in concert. The deluxe vinyl version includes inserted copies of the CD and DVD. Fellow Austin-based songwriter Jon Dee Graham opened the shows and joins the band on a version of his tune \"Laredo\" on the bonus DVD.\n\nJAMES McMURTRY ALBUMS REISSUED: 'CHILDISH THINGS' & 'LIVE IN AUGHT-THREE' \nOn February 1, 2011, two of James McMurtry's most popular albums, Childish Things and Live in Aught-Three were reissued by Lightning Rod Records. Live in Aught-Three has been remastered since its original 2004 release and will be available on vinyl for the first time. The deluxe double LP also includes a copy of the album on CD.\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

Riley (born Jeanne Carolyn Stephenson on October 19, 1945) is an American country and gospel music singer.\n\nShe is known for her major 1968 hit Harper Valley PTA that made her the first ever female singer to have a song reach #1 on both the country and pop music charts. The record quickly became one of the most legendary country music songs of all time. Written by Tom T. Hall, the song was released on the Plantation Records label. At the time, the lyrics were seen as risqué with \"attitude\" and the attractive Riley was marketed as a sex symbol dressed in an evocative tight mini-skirt and leather Go-Go boots.\n\nShe became a much talked about overnight sensation, and the song earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the Country Music Association Single of the Year award. The song itself was a phenomenon that led to a 1978 motion picture and the 1981 Harper Valley PTA television show. Riley made country music history in 1969 as the first female vocalist to have her own major network variety special.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, and well into the 1970s, Riley ranked among the most popular female vocalists in the country music industry with five Grammy nominations and four Country Music Association nominations. Her other major country hits include \"The Girl Most Likely\" (1968), \"Country Girl\" (1970), \"Oh, Singer\" (1971), \"Good Enough to Be Your Wife\" (1971), and \"Give Myself a Party\" (1972). Riley recorded for MGM Records from 1972 to 1975 and later for Warner Bros. Records and MCA Records.\n\nHer beauty and popularity brought a number of offers from Hollywood and she appeared with Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Bette Davis, Tom Jones, Ed Sullivan, and others on various television programs.\n\nIn the 1970s, she became a born again Christian and began recording gospel music with some frequency. However, her life has been plagued by bouts of severe depression that at one point left her bed-ridden for six years.\n\nJeannie C. Riley wrote an autobiography, From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top that was published in 1980 and brought her much renewed attention. She contined to tour and record through to the 1990s.

He runs this all through a gamut of loop pedals, echo and distortion units and through the speakers to leave a crowd quite literally awe-struck, standing there going...\"where is this all coming from?\"\n\nAnd there's the buzz word - Crowd.\nWhereas Jeremy still sees his project as having the right amount of \"pop-sensibility\" that will appeal to a mass audience from a listening point of view, he much prefers playing live. Interactivity and crowd participation are key to the creation of his multi-layered structure of beats and rhythms. Having built his career from a very early stage with rapper, Trak, the two exude a perfectly ordered mish-mash of folk, hip-hop, blue-grass funk and blues.\n\nNot simply content with growing his own musical career, Jeremy is also quite literally growing Cape Town and South Africa, heading up the agricultural revolution that is GreenPop - An initiative which is spearheading the conscious push to plant more trees and reduce carbon emissions, amongst other noble ideals.\n\nKeep checking Jeremy Loops’ facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeremy-Loops/122132931173760) for future loop station imagination!\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Jerry Lee Lewis": {
    "bio": "Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29, 1935 in Ferriday, Louisiana, U.S. died October 28, 2022 in DeSoto County, Mississippi) was an American rock and roll and country music singer, songwriter, and pianist, as well as an early pioneer of rock and roll music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Country Music Hall Of Fame in 2022. his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. His nickname is The Killer.\n\nLike Elvis Presley, he was raised singing the Christian gospel music of integrated southern Pentecostal churches. In 1950 he attended Southwestern Bible Institute in Texas but was expelled for misconduct, including playing rock and roll versions of hymns in church. Pearry Green (then president of the student body) related how during a talent show Jerry played some worldly music. The next morning the Dean of the school called both Jerry and Pearry into his office to expel them both. Jerry then said that Pearry shouldn't be expelled because \"he didn't know what I was going to do.\"  Years later Pearry asked Jerry: \"Are you still playing the devil's music?\" Jerry replied, \"Yes, I am. But you know it's strange, the same music that they kicked me out of school for is the same kind of music they play in their churches today. The difference is, I know I am playing for the devil and they don't.\"\n\nLeaving religious music behind, he became a part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound, cutting his first record in 1954. Two years later, at Sun Records studio in Memphis, Tennessee, producer and engineer Jack Clement discovered and recorded Lewis for the Sun label, while owner Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida. As a result, Lewis joined Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash as stars who began their recording careers at Sun Studios around this same time.\n\n \nLewis' first recording at Sun studios was his own distinct version of the country ballad Crazy Arms. In 1957, his piano and the pure rock and roll sound of Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On propelled him to international fame. Great Balls of Fire soon followed, and would become his biggest hit. Watching and listening to Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis said if he could play the piano like that, he'd quit singing. Lewis' early billing was Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano.\n\nLewis was a pioneer of piano rock, not only through his sound by also through his dynamic performance. He would often kick the piano bench out of the way to play standing, rake his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic accent, and even sit down on it. His frenetic performance style can be seen in films such as High School Confidential (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and Jamboree. These performance techniques have been adopted by recent piano rock artists, notably admirer Elton John.

  "Jimi Hendrix": {
    "bio": "James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\".\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.\nHendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"\nHendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year, and in 1968, Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year. Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the band's three studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.

  "Jimmy Cliff": {
    "bio": "Jimmy Cliff OM (Jamaican Order of Merit) (born James Chambers in St. Catherine, Jamaica, on 1 April 1948; died 24 November 2025) was a Jamaican reggae musician remembered for songs like \"Sittin' in Limbo\", \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and the title track from \"The Harder They Come\", a film soundtrack which helped popularise reggae across the world. At the time of his death, he was the only living reggae musician to hold the Order of Merit, the highest honour that can be granted by the Jamaican government for achievements in the arts and sciences. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. \n\nCliff moved to Kingston in 1962. After he released two singles that failed to make much of an impression, his career took off when his \"Hurricane Hattie\" became a hit, while he was aged just 14; it was produced by Leslie Kong, with whom Cliff would remain until Kong's death. Later local hit singles included \"King of Kings\", \"Dearest Beverley\" and \"Pride and Passion\". In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of the Jamaican representatives at the World's Fair, and Cliff soon signed to Island Records and moved to Britain. Island initially (and unsuccessfully) tried to sell Cliff to the rock audience, but his career took off in the late 1960s. His international debut album was Hard Road to Travel, which received excellent reviews and included \"Waterfall\", a Brazilian hit that won the International Song Festival. \n\n\"Waterfall\" was followed in 1969 by \"Wonderful World, Beautiful People\" and \"Vietnam\" in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. Folk rock singer-songwriter Bob Dylan even called \"Vietnam\" the best protest song he'd ever heard. Wonderful World included a cover of Cat Stevens' \"Wild World\", which was a success in 1970. \n\nLeslie Kong died of a heart attack in 1971. The soundtrack to the reggae film The Harder They Come was a huge success that sold well across the world, but did not break Cliff into the mainstream. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa, exploring his newfound Muslim spirituality. He quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with Kool & the Gang for Power & the Glory (1983). (During the 1981 River Tour, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band added Cliff's little-known \"Trapped\" to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985's We Are the World benefit album.) The follow-up, Cliff Hanger (1985) won a Grammy Award, though it was his last major success in the U.S. until 1993. He continued to sell well in Jamaica and, to a lesser extent, the UK, returning to the mainstream pop charts in the U.S. and elsewhere with a version of Johnny Nash's \"I Can See Clearly Now\" on the Cool Runnings film soundtrack in 1993 .\n\nIn 2002, Cliff released his album, Fantastic Plastic People in Europe, after first providing free downloads using Delacove's People Music Media p2p software. This album featured collaborations with Joe Strummer, Annie Lennox, and Sting as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff's original hits. In 2004 Cliff completely reworked the songs, dropping the traditional reggae in favor of an electronica sound, for inclusion in Black Magic. \n\nCliff also covered the famous African song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". \n\nHis recording of 'You Can Get It If You Really Want' was used as a campaign anthem by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in the 1990 election in Nicaragua (they lost). It was also adopted by the British Conservative Party during their annual conference in October, 2007.

    "bio": "John Robert Joe Cocker OBE (20 May 1944 – 22 December 2014) was an English singer known for his gritty, blues-influenced vocal style and expressive stage presence. Many of his most successful singles, including \"Feelin' Alright?\" and \"Unchain My Heart\", were cover versions of previously released songs, although he also wrote material for several of his albums, often collaborating with Chris Stainton.\n\nHis debut album included a cover of the Beatles song \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", which played a major role in establishing his career. The single reached number one in the United Kingdom in 1968, became a prominent feature of his live performances such as at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969 and the Party at the Palace in 2002, and later became widely recognized as the theme song for the American television series \"The Wonder Years\". His second album featured another Beatles cover, \"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\". A 1970 United States tour resulted in the live double album \"Mad Dogs & Englishmen\", featuring a large ensemble directed by Leon Russell. In 1974, his recording of \"You Are So Beautiful\" reached number five in the United States and became one of his most closely associated songs. His highest-selling single was the number one hit \"Up Where We Belong\", a duet with Jennifer Warnes that earned a Grammy Award in 1983. Over a 43-year career, he released 22 studio albums.\n\nIn 1993, Cocker was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Solo Artist. He received a Sheffield Legends plaque in 2007 and was appointed OBE in 2008 for services to music. Rolling Stone ranked him number 97 on its list of the 100 greatest singers.

  "Joe Ely": {
    "bio": "Joe Ely (born in Amarillo, Texas, on 9 February 1947; died 15 December 2025) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist remembered as one of the main movers\" of Austin, Texas' progressive country scene in the 1970s and 1980s, and for his genre-crossing career performing with Bruce Springsteen, Uncle Tupelo, Los Super Seven, The Chieftains, James McMurtry, The Clash, Lyle Lovett, John Hiatt, and Guy Clark. In October 2022, he was inducted to the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. \n\nEly  spent his formative years from age 12 in Lubbock, Texas. Shortly after high school, in 1970, with fellow Lubbock musicians Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock, he formed  The Flatlanders. According to Ely, \"Jimmie was like a well of country music. He knew everything about it. And Butch was from the folk world. I was kinda the rock & roll guy, and we almost had a triad. We hit it off and started playing a lot together. That opened up a whole new world I had never known existed.\" In 1972, the band released their first and— until 2002's Now Again— only album, but have appeared together on each other's albums. Since the band's initial break-up just after their album was cut, the three musicians have followed individual paths.\n\nEly's own first album, self titled, was released in 1977. The following year, his band played London where he met punk rock group The Clash. Impressed with each other's performances, the two bands would later tour together, including appearances in Ely's hometown of Lubbock, as well as Laredo and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, across the border from El Paso, Texas.\n\nSince then, a steady stream of albums have followed, most on the MCA label. Ely's live performances have become legendary, and he has released a live album roughly every ten years (the last was Live at Antone's in 2000). He has had a genre-crossing career, performing with Bruce Springsteen, Los Super Seven, David Grissom, and James McMurtry in addition to his early work with The Clash and more recent acoustic tours with Lyle Lovett, John Hiatt, and Guy Clark. \n\nIn the late 1990s, Ely was asked to write songs for Robert Redford's movie The Horse Whisperer, which led to reforming The Flatlanders with Gilmore and Hancock for an appearance on the movie soundtrack. A new album from the trio followed in 2002, with a third in 2004. \n\nIn February 2007, Ely released \"Happy Songs From Rattlesnake Gulch\" on his own label, Rack 'Em Records. A book of Ely's writings was published in early 2007 by the University of Texas Press. Ely also released a second album of old lyrics that he has finally recorded. \n\nSeveral other reissues of Ely's previous work were released in 2007 on Rack 'Em.  \n\nIn 2011, Ely released the critically acclaimed album, Satisfied at Last. \n\nIn September 2015, Ely released Panhandle Rambler, an album with a reflective west Texas feel. \n\nEly spent 2016 as the reigning \"Texas State Musician\", a one-year designation which he formally accepted in a ceremony at the State Legislature that spring.[10]\n\nIn October 2022, he was inducted to the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame.

    "bio": "Joe Tex (Joseph Arrington, Jr., August 8, 1935 – August 13, 1982) was an American rhythm & blues singer. Tex's last name was Arrington.  He later changed it to Hazziez after conversion to Islam but his stage name was Joe Tex, for Texas, the state he was born & later died in.\nHe gained success in the 1960s and 1970s with his brand of Southern soul, which mixed the styles of country, gospel and rhythm and blues.\nBorn in Rogers, Texas, in 1935 and raised in Baytown, TX, Tex's career started after he was signed to King Records in 1955 following four wins at the Apollo Theater. Between that year and 1964, however, Tex struggled to find hits and by the time he finally recorded his first hit, \"Hold What You've Got\", in 1964, he had recorded thirty prior singles that were deemed failures on the charts. Tex went on to have three million-selling hits, \"Hold What You've Got\" (1965), \"Skinny Legs and All\" (1967) and \"I Gotcha\" (1972).\n\nJoe Tex  with the raspy voice & charm of a southern preacher and the linguistic skills of a true street hustler made a string of funky chart topping hits and occasional raps with moral themes. His peak as a hitmaker occured in the mid & late 60's, but extended into the 70's disco era.\n\nHis breakthrough 1965 song \"Hold What You've Got\" topped both the Pop and R&B charts. In 1966 he released \"I Believe I'm Gonna Make It\", which was the first major pop record associated with the Vietnam War. His style was usually more light hearted fare, like \"S.Y.S.L.J.F.M. (The Letter Song)\" and his biggest hit \"Skinny Legs And All\".\n\nHis last major record was 1972's funky jam \"I Gotcha\", a #1 song. It was after this release that he converted to Islam. After the death of Elijah Mohamed in 1975, Joe Tex received the blessing and approval of the Nation of Islam to begin recording and performing again. His career resurgence came as the disco years were in full swing. His late career comeback song was \"Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)\".

  "John Lee Hooker": {
    "bio": "John Lee Hooker (Coahoma County,  Mississippi, August 22, 1917 – Los Altos, California, June 21, 2001) was a highly influential American blues singer, guitarist and songwriter.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker could be said to embody his own unique genre of the blues, often incorporating the boogie-woogie piano style and a driving rhythm into his masterful and idiosyncratic blues guitar and singing. His best known songs include \"Boogie Chillen\" (1948) and \"Boom Boom\" (1962).\n\nThere is some debate as to the year of John Lee Hooker's birth, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been cited, 1917 (the date on his grave marker in Oakland, California) is the one most commonly cited although Hooker himself claimed, at times, 1920.\n\nHooker was the youngest of the eleven children of William Hooker (1871–1923), a sharecropper and a Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (1875–?). \nHooker and his siblings were home-schooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs, with his earliest musical exposure being the spirituals sung in church. \nIn 1921, his parents separated. The next year, his mother married William Moore, a blues singer who provided John's first introduction to the guitar (and whom John would later credit for his distinctive playing style). The year after that (1923), John's natural father died; and at age 15, John ran away from home, never to see his mother and stepfather again.\n \nHe was a cousin of Earl Hooker,\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and occasionally performed at house parties. He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, drifting until he found himself in Detroit in 1948 working at Ford Motor Company. He felt right at home near the blues venues and saloons on Hastings Street, the heart of black entertainment on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its piano players, guitar players were scarce. Performing in Detroit clubs, his popularity grew quickly, and seeking a louder instrument than his crude acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.\n\nThough he stuttered slightly in his normal speech, he performed in a half-spoken style that became his trademark. Rhythmically, his music was free, a property common with early acoustic Delta blues musicians. His vocal phrasing was less closely tied to specific bars than most blues singers'. This casual, rambling style had been gradually diminishing with the onset of electric blues bands from Chicago but, even when not playing solo, Hooker retained it in his sound.\n\nHooker's recording career began in 1948 with the hit single, \"Boogie Chillen\" cut in a studio near Wayne State University.\n\nDespite being illiterate, he was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting the occasionally traditional blues lyric (such as \"if I was chief of police, I would run her right out of town\"), he freely invented many of his songs from scratch. Recording studios in the 50s rarely paid black musicians more than a pittance, so Hooker would spend the night wandering from studio to studio, coming up with new songs or variations on his songs for each studio. Due to his recording contract, he would record these songs under obvious pseudonyms such as \"John Lee Booker,\" \"Johnny Hooker\", or \"John Cooker\".\n\nHis early solo songs were recorded under Bernie Besman.\nJohn Lee Hooker rarely played on a standard beat, changing tempo to fit the needs of the song. This made it nearly impossible to add backing tracks. As a result, Besman would record Hooker, in addition to playing guitar and singing, stomping along with the music on a wooden palette.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker's guitar playing is closely aligned with piano Boogie Woogie. He would play the walking bass pattern with his thumb, stopping to emphasize the end of a line with a series of trills, done by rapid hammer-ons and pull-offs. The songs that most epitomize his early sound are \"Boogie Chillen,\" about being 17 and wanting to go out to dance at the Boogie clubs, \"Baby Please Don't Go,\" a more typical blues song, summed up by its title, and \"Tupelo,\" a stunningly sad song about the flooding of Tupelo, Mississippi.\n\nHe maintained a solo career, popular with blues and folk music fans of the early 1960s and crossed over to white audiences, giving an early opportunity to the young Bob Dylan. As he got older, he added more and more people to his band, changing his live show from simply Hooker with his guitar to a large band, with Hooker singing.\n\n\nIn 1989 he joined with a number of musicians, including Keith Richards and Carlos Santana to record The Healer, which won a Grammy award — one of many awards.\n\nHe fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died soon afterwards at the age of 83.\n\nHooker recorded over 100 albums and lived the last years of his life in San Francisco, California, where he licensed a nightclub to use the name Boom Boom Room, after one of his hits.\n\nAmong his many awards, John Lee Hooker has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 1991 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Two of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom\" were named to the list of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nJohn Lee recorded several songs with Van Morrison, including \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\", \"The Healing Game\" and \"I Cover the Waterfront\". He also appeared on stage with Van Morrison several times, some of which was released on the live album \"A Night in San Francisco\".\n\nJohn Lee also recorded in the sixties with british blues band The Groundhogs. These recordings are still available as a CD \"John Lee Hooker with The Groundhogs\". More importantly, Hooker recorded with the Blues-rock outfit Canned Heat, delivering the album 'Hooker N' Heat' in 1971.  Hooker was influential and topical even in his lifetime, as evidenced in the MC5 cover of \"Motor City's Burning\" on their first album, recorded almost immediately after the riots which are the song's topic.

  "John Lennon": {
    "bio": "John Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter and musician who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-songwriter, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His work included music, writing, drawings and film. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.\n\nBorn in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed The Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called \"the smart Beatle\", Lennon initially was the group's de facto leader, a role he gradually ceded to McCartney. Through his songwriting in the Beatles, he embraced myriad musical influences, initially writing and co-writing rock and pop-oriented hit songs in the band's early years, then later incorporating experimental elements into his compositions in the latter half of the Beatles' career as his songs became known for their increasing innovation. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including How I Won the War, and authoring In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with \"All You Need Is Love\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins for Peace and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, several more films, his solo debut John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and the international top-10 singles \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Instant Karma!\", \"Imagine\", and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year deportation attempt by the Nixon administration. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced Harry Nilsson's album Pussy Cats. He also had chart-topping collaborations with Elton John (\"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\") and David Bowie (\"Fame\"). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration Double Fantasy. He was murdered by a Beatles fan, Mark David Chapman, three weeks after the album's release.\n\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Double Fantasy, his best-selling album, won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. That year, he won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and 38th greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).\n\nStudio albums\nJohn Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970)\nImagine (1971)\nSome Time in New York City (with Yoko Ono, 1972)\nMind Games (1973)\nWalls and Bridges (1974)\nRock 'n' Roll (1975)\nDouble Fantasy (with Yoko Ono, 1980)\nMilk and Honey (Posthumous with Yoko Ono, 1984)\n\nExperimental studio albums with Yoko Ono\nUnfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins (1968)\nUnfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions (1969)\nWedding Album (1969) User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Johnnie Taylor": {
    "bio": "Johnnie Harrison Taylor (born May 5, 1934, Crawfordsville, Arkansas; died May 31, 2000, Dallas, Texas) was an American musician that sang in a wide variety of genres, including blues, disco, gospel, pop, and soul. Often using an energetic, belting delivery, he's perhaps best known for his work for the iconic Stax/Volt label, particularly with southern soul classics such as \"Who's Making Love\" and \"Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone\" in which he held his own against friendly rivals such as Otis Redding and Sam & Dave.\n\nGrowing up amidst music, Taylor had one release, \"Somewhere to Lay My Head\", on Chicago's Chance Records in the 50s as part of a doo-wop group called Five Echoes. Taylor was also part of the gospel group, The Highway QC's also, replacing r&b artist Sam Cooke that had left to become the lead singer of the Soul Stirrers in 1951. Then, after Cooke left the Soul Stirrers in 1957, Taylor was hired to take Cooke's place as lead singer. \n\nA few years later, after Cooke had established his independent SAR Records, Taylor signed on and recorded \"Rome Wasn't Built In A Day\" in 1962. However, SAR Records quickly became defunct after Cooke's tradic early death in 1964.\n\nIn 1966, Taylor moved to Stax Records in Memphis, where he was dubbed \"The Philosopher of Soul\". While there he recorded with the label's house band, Booker T. & the MGs. His hits included \"I Had a Dream\", \"I've Got to Love Somebody's Baby\" (both written by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter) and most notably \"Who's Making Love?\", which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Top 40 and No. 1 on the R&B charts in 1968. During his tenure at Stax, he became an R&B star, with over a dozen chart successes, such as \"Cheaper to Keep Her\" (Mack Rice) and producer Don Davis's \"I Believe in You (You Believe in Me)\". \n\nAfter Stax folded in the mid 1970s, Taylor switched to Columbia Records, where he made his best-known hit, \"Disco Lady\", in 1976. \"Disco Lady\" was the first certified platinum single. Columbia pigeonholed Taylor as a disco artist, however, and neglected his wide-ranging talent. Not surprisingly, his record sales slipped. \n\nAfter a brief stint at Beverly Glen Records, Taylor signed with Malaco Records after the label's founder Tommy Couch and producing partner Wolf Stephenson heard him sing at blues singer Z.Z. Hill's funeral in the spring of 1984. Backed by members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section as well as in-house veterans like former Stax keyboardist Carson Whitsett, Malaco gave Taylor the type of recording freedom that Stax had given him in the late 1960s and early 1970s, enabling him to record ten albums for the Malaco label in his sixteen year stint. Taylor's record sales were good but not enough for the singer to receive the measure of stardom he once had.\n\nIn 1996, Taylor's eighth album for Malaco, Good Love!, made it to Number One on Billboard's Blues chart (#15 R&B), the biggest record in Malaco's history. \nMalaco recorded a live video of Taylor at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas in the summer of 1997.\n\nJohnnie Taylor's 1999 album, \"Gotta Get the Groove Back\", also reached the # 1 Position on the Billboard Blues Charts. This album which featured veteran songwriter, Lamar Thmas (Woman don't be Afraid) was also a Grammy Nominated album during the same year that Johnnie passed.\n \nTaylor was given a Pioneer Award by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1999. He died in Dallas at the age of 66.\n\nIn what would turn out to be a sad foreshadowing, Taylor's final song was \"Soul Heaven\", in which he dreamed of being at a concert featuring deceased Soul music icons Otis Redding, Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, and MGs drummer Al Jackson, among others. In one verse, Taylor sang, \"I didn't want to wake up/I was havin' such a good time\". User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Johnny Adams": {
    "bio": "January 5, 1932 - September 14, 1998\nAmerican blues singer from New Orleans, Louisiana. He was known as \"The Tan Canary\" for the amazing range of his singing voice and his gospel influenced style. He began his career singing gospel, but crossed over to secular music in 1959 and scored a national hit with the single \"I Won't Cry.\" That was followed by a string of regional hits in the 1960s which included \"Release Me\" and \"Reconsider Me.\"\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Adams recorded several award-winning albums for Rounder Records. He died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1998 after a long battle with cancer\n\n(2) Renowned around his Crescent City home base as \"the Tan Canary\" for his extraordinary set of soulfully soaring pipes, veteran R&B vocalist Johnny Adams tackled an exceptionally wide variety of material for Rounder in his later years; elegantly rendered tribute albums to legendary songwriters Doc Pomus and Percy Mayfield preceded forays into mellow, jazzier pastures. But then, Adams was never particularly into the parade-beat grooves that traditionally define the New Orleans R&B sound, preferring to deliver sophisticated soul ballads draped in strings. \n\n Adams sang gospel professionally before crossing over to the secular world in 1959. Songwriter Dorothy LaBostrie -- the woman responsible for cleaning up the bawdy lyrics of Little Richard's \"Tutti Frutti\" enough for worldwide consumption -- convinced her neighbor, Adams, to sing her tasty ballad \"I Won't Cry.\" The track, produced by a teenaged Mac Rebennack, was released on Joe Ruffino's Ric logo, and Adams was on his way. He waxed some outstanding follow-ups for Ric, notably \"A Losing Battle\" (the Rebennack-penned gem proved Adams' first national R&B hit in 1962) and \"Life Is a Struggle.\" \n\n After a prolonged dry spell, Adams resurfaced in 1968 with an impassioned R&B revival of Jimmy Heap's country standard \"Release Me\" for Shelby Singleton's SSS imprint that blossomed into a national hit. Even more arresting was Adams' magnificent 1969 country-soul classic \"Reconsider Me,\" his lone leap into the R&B Top Ten; in it, he swoops effortlessly up to a death-defying falsetto range to drive his anguished message home with fervor. \n\n Despite several worthy SSS follow-ups (\"I Can't Be All Bad\" was another sizable seller), Adams never traversed those lofty commercial heights again (particularly disappointing was a short stay at Atlantic). But he found a new extended recording life at Rounder; his 1984 set, From the Heart, proved to the world that this Tan Canary could still chirp like a champ. With producer Scott Billington, he recorded some nine albums for the label prior to his cancer-related death on September 14, 1998. ~ Bill Dahl, Rovi User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Johnny Cash": {
    "bio": "Johnny Cash (born J.R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer, guitarist, actor, songwriter, author. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel.\n\nCash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black.\" He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,\" followed by his signature song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\n\nMuch of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His other signature songs include \"I Walk the Line\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\", and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their wedding); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\", and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Rusty Cage\" by Soundgarden.\n\nJohnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, to Ray Cash and Carrie Cloveree (née Rivers). He was the fourth of seven children, who were in birth order: Roy, Margaret Louise, Jack, J. R., Reba, Joanne, and Tommy (who also became a successful country artist). He was primarily of English and Scottish descent. As an adult he traced his surname to 11th-century Fife, after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart. Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family.\n\nAt birth, Cash was named J. R. Cash. When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force, he was not permitted to use initials as a first name, so he changed his name to John R. Cash. In 1955, when signing with Sun Records, he started going by Johnny Cash.\n\nIn March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal colony established to give poor families a chance to work land that they had a chance to own as a result. Cash started working in cotton fields at the age of five, singing along with his family while working. The Cash farm experienced a flood during the family's time in Dyess, which led Cash later to write the song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Consequently, Cash had sympathy for the poor and working class throughout his life.\n\nCash was very close to his older brother, Jack. On Saturday May 12, 1944, Jack was pulled into an unguarded table saw at his high school while cutting oak into fence posts as his job and was almost cut in two. He lingered until the following Saturday, when he died. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident; according to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny, his mother, and even Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day. His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother, but Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money at the time. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.\n\nCash's early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a high-tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed.\n\nIn high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother's Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.\n\nIn 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy. According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.\n\nDuring the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002). American IV included cover songs by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover \"Hurt\", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition. The video for \"Hurt\" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.\n\nJune Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record, completing 60 more songs in the last four months of his life, and even performed a few surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing \"Ring of Fire\", Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage:\n\n\"The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart. \"\n\nCash continued to record until shortly before his death. His final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of \"Like the 309\", which appeared on American V: A Hundred Highways in 2006, and the final song he completed, \"Engine 143\", which was recorded for his son John Carter Cash for a planned Carter Family tribute album.

  "Johnny Winter": {
    "bio": "John Dawson \"Johnny\" Winter III (born February 23, 1944 died July 16, 2014) was an American blues guitarist, singer, and producer. Best known for his late 1960s and 1970s high-energy blues rock albums and live performances, Winter also produced three Grammy Award-winning albums for blues legend Muddy Waters. Since his time with Waters, Johnny Winter has recorded several Grammy-nominated blues albums and continues to tour extensively. In 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame and in 2003, he was ranked as 74th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\", a debatable ranking based on those listed ahead of him as being more talented than Johnny.\n\nJohnny Winter, along with his brother Edgar Winter, were nurtured at an early age by their parents in musical pursuits. Both he and his brother, who were born with albinism, began performing at an early age. When he was ten-years old, Winter appeared on a local children's show, playing ukelele and singing Everly Brothers songs with his brother.\n\nHis recording career began at the age of fifteen, when his band Johnny and the Jammers released \"School Day Blues\" on a Houston record label. During this same period, he was able to see performances by classic blues artists such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Bobby Bland. In the early days Winter would sometimes sit in with Roy Head and The Traits when they performed in the Beaumont, Texas area, and in 1967, Winter recorded a single with The Traits: \"Tramp\" backed with \"Parchman Farm\" (Universal Records 30496). In 1968, he released his first album The Progressive Blues Experiment, on Austin's Sonobeat Records.\n\nWinter caught his biggest break in December 1968, when Mike Bloomfield, whom he met and jammed with in Chicago, invited him to sing and play a song during a Bloomfield and Al Kooper concert at the Fillmore East in New York. As it happened, representatives of Columbia Records (which had released the Top Ten Bloomfield/Kooper Super Session album) were at the concert. Winter played and sang B.B. King's \"It's My Own Fault\" to loud applause and, within a few days, was signed to reportedly what was then the largest advance in the history of the recording industry–$600,000.\n\nWinter's first Columbia album, Johnny Winter was recorded and released in 1969. It featured the same backing musicians with whom he recorded The Progressive Blues Experiment, bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Uncle John Turner, plus Edgar Winter on keyboards and saxophone, and (for his \"Mean Mistreater\") blues legends Willie Dixon on upright bass and Big Walter Horton on harmonica. The album featured a few selections that became Winter signature songs, including his composition \"Dallas\" (an acoustic blues, on which Winter played a steel-bodied, resonator guitar), John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson's \"Good Morning Little School Girl\", and B.B. King's \"Be Careful With A Fool\".\n\nThe album's success coincided with Imperial Records picking up The Progressive Blues Experiment for wider release. The same year, the Winter trio toured and performed at several rock festivals, including Woodstock. With brother Edgar added as a full member of the group, Winter also recorded his second album, Second Winter in Nashville in 1969. The two-record album, which only had three recorded sides (the fourth was blank), introduced a couple more staples of Winter's concerts, including Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" and Bob Dylan's \"Highway 61 Revisited\".\n\nIn 1984, Winter began recording for several labels, including Alligator Records and Point Blank Records, where he has focused on blues-oriented material. He continues to perform live, including festivals throughout North America and Europe. Winter has headlined such prestigious events as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, Swedish Rock Fest, Warren Haynes X-mas jam, and Europe’s Rockpalast. He also performed with the Allman Brothers at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan on the 40th anniversary of their debut. In 2007 and 2010, Winter performed at Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festivals. Two guitar instructional DVDs have been produced by Cherry Lane Music and the Hal Leonard Corporation. The Gibson Guitar Company released the signature Johnny Winter Firebird guitar in a ceremony in Nashville with Slash presenting.\n\nIn 2004, Winter received a Grammy nomination for his I’m a Bluesman album. Backing him are guitarist Paul Nelson, bassist Scott Spray, and drummer Vito Liuzzi. Beginning in 2007, a series of live Winter albums titled the Live Bootleg Series and a live DVD have all entered the Top 10 Billboard Blues charts. In 2009, The Woodstock Experience album was released, which includes eight songs that Winter performed at the 1969 festival. Johnny Winter is signed to Megaforce Records, who will release a new studio album titled Roots on September 27, 2011. It will include Winter's interpretation of eleven early blues and rock 'n' roll classics and feature several guest artists.\n\nWinter produced three Grammy Award-winning albums by Muddy Waters, Hard Again (1977), I'm Ready (1978), and Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters – Live (1979). Several Winter albums were also nominated for Grammy Awards. In 1980, Winter was on the cover of the first issue of Guitar World and in 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. \n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

His best known song at the time was probably \"Jelly, Jelly\", He recorded in a wide variety of contexts, from recordings in which he was accompanied only by his own guitar playing to others in which he was backed by jazz groups and gospel vocal groups. He was prominently associated with the civil rights movement in the 1940s.\n\nSome of his involvement in political causes in the 1940s resulted in him being blacklisted.Controversially, to escape the blacklist, he testified to the House Un-American Activities Committee regarding Communist influence in the entertainment industry and African-American community. He defended his testimony as a friendly witness to HUAC by claiming that the scope of his testimony was limited, that he did not state anything that was not already known, and that he was sincerely opposed to Communism. However, his testimony affected his posthumous reputation, which has only begun to recover in recent years.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s until his death, he primarily performed at folk music venues and festivals. He was seen as an influence by Ray Charles, who similarly broke considerable barriers that had hampered blues musicians in the past.\n\nOn 26 June 1998, the United States Postal Service issued a 32-cent postage stamp honoring Josh White.\n\nJosh White performed the version of \"House of the Rising Sun\" that influenced the famous version by The Animals. He also played a version of \"In My Time of Dying\" (also known as \"Jesus Gunna Make Up My Dyin' Bed\", which was covered by Led Zeppelin as In My Time of Dying.\n\nJosh White's son, Josh White Jr., is a singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, educator, and social activist.\n\n 2) Josh White (born May 25, 1973) is a Christian musician  who has been writing and releasing worship music for the Church for nearly a decade, under various different identities - Telecast, The Followers, & Pilgrim. His solo releases are stripped-down, raw-sounding folk worship music. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "June Carter Cash & Johnny Cash": {
    "bio": "The country duo of Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter\n\nQuite possibly, the most recognizable voice in all of country music belongs to \"The Man in Black,\" Johnny Cash. His forays into the fields of country, folk, rock and even gospel music, distinguish Cash as one of the most intriguing performers in all of 20th century popular music. In addition to one of the most impressive musical careers of all time, he enjoyed success and garnered tremendous respect as an author, actor and Biblical scholar.\n\nBorn Feb. 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Ark., Johnny Cash was born John R. Cash, one of six children belonging to Ray and Carrie Rivers Cash. When John was 3 years old, his father took advantage of a new Roosevelt farm program and moved his young family to Dyess Colony in northeast Arkansas. There the Cash family farmed 20 acres of cotton and other seasonal crops, and young John worked alongside his parents and siblings in the fields.\n\nBy 1967, though, Cash managed to overcome his addiction with the help of his singing partner June Carter and her family. In 1968, he and Carter were married and his career experienced a renaissance. Throughout the remainder of the decade and into the 1970s, Cash was at the top of his game. A pair of live recordings made at Folsom Prison and San Quentin both went gold and a passel of awards followed including the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year and Male Vocalist awards in 1969.\n\nIn 1980, at the age of 48, Johnny Cash became the youngest living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame bestowed its honor on him in 1995, thus making him one of a handful of country artists in both organizations.\n\nAfter losing his wife June Carter Cash unexpectedly in May 2003, Johnny Cash passed away Sept. 12, 2003 at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tenn. from complications from diabetes, a little before his with his biography and history with June Carter to be showed to world.

  "Kelley Hunt": {
    "bio": "Kelley Hunt’s love for her craft was fine tuned listening to early blues, R&B, roots rock, jazz and gospel influences including Ruth Brown, Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, Ann Peebles, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, Aretha Franklin, Charles Brown, Wanda Jackson and a crossection of the New Orleans/St. Louis/KC piano traditions of Professor Longhair, Toots Washington, Johnnie Johnson and Kansas City masters Jay McShann and Mary Lou Williams among others. While subtle reminders of those very traditional influences can be heard in Kelley’s live performances and recordings, her lyrics, soul and passion are all her own.\n\nThe result has been critical praise, \"surprises don't often crop up on the well-trodden blues circuit. So welcome Kelley Hunt. This Kansan is a full-blown phenomenon: Powerhouse singer, hardboogieing pianist, polished songwriter…” - Minneapolis Star Tribune. “…the freshest slant on classic R&B you're likely to hear these days. She's a tough woman who makes a hip and burly sound.\" - Westword Denver.\n\nAlong with critical acclaim Kelley’s blistering live performances over the last several years have won over legions of blues and roots music fans making her a crowd favorite at over 100 blues and music festivals across North America.\n\nOn a trip to Nashville in 2001 Hunt took a meeting with one of the most respected producers in town, Garth Fundis, (Trisha Yearwood, Keith Whitley, New Grass Revival). Her intent was simply to pitch him a few songs for Trisha Yearwood. Fortunately, one of those songs was not yet on CD so Kelley sat down at the grand piano in Sound Emporium’s Studio B and performed it live for Garth. After requesting her to play several more Fundis (taken with her talent) wanted to do more than cut one of her songs, he decided he wanted to take her on as an artist. \"When I first heard Kelley Hunt sit down at a piano and sing my reaction was immediate; this was not only a great musician but an artist who is a 'natural'. Like a great athlete, painter, or writer, I believe she was born with a musical gift (soul) that she couldn't escape from if she wanted to\" said Fundis.\n\nGarth then decided to call his friend Gary Nicholson, Grammy Award winning producer (Delbert McClinton), who was also an accomplished musician and songwriter. Thinking they would be a natural creative fit, Garth promoted a meeting between Hunt and Nicholson just to see what would happen. From the start the chemistry was right and great song collaborations immediately blossomed. Shortly thereafter Garth asked Gary to co-produce the new project with him. Also taken with Kelley’s talent and passion he gladly accepted. When asked about her ability as a singer Nicholson said, “Kelley has found that soul space that all singers really want to be coming from and she lives there. She's a song's best friend.”\n\nWhile taking her time writing and recording material for the album, Kelley continued to tour across North America, building up a fan base (her previous two releases on 88 Records have sold a combined 80,000 copies). Her growing grass-roots popularity built a buzz prompting invites to perform on NPR/PRI’s “A Prairie Home Companion,” (seven times) and \"Beale Street Caravan\" The Blues Foundation's syndicated radio show (six times). Other appearances include \"House of Blues Radio Hour\", a 2001 appearance on the PBS-TV music series \"Backstage Pass\" and numerous other syndicated blues radio vehicles. While in Los Angeles on business Fundis met with friend and former co-worker Pam Hughes and played her some rough tracks from Kelley’s sessions. Pam was impressed and immediately suggested that Kelley’s new project land on her newly formed label Coda Terra.\n\nOver the period of the next year Kelley finished recording New Shade of Blue at Sound Emporium with Garth and Gary by her side. They chose to start the album off with mid-tempo “Waking Up Slow.” “ I wanted that to be the first track on the album because I felt it embodied the spirit of the rest of the record,” said Fundis. Although the project boasts 12 strong tracks standouts include a gospel-feel take on Jesse Winchester’s “That’s What Makes You Strong,” her own intense reading of Jim Lauderdale’s alt-country “Why Do I Love You”, “Darkness,” a haunting introspection from Hunt’s pen written well before the recording process began and “Deal With It”, a raucous up-tempo duet with Delbert McClinton that deals with the challenges of making a relationship work.\n\nTheir labor of love New Shade of Blue debuted at #9 on the Billboard Blues chart late this summer and was met with critical acclaim from writers across the country. Kelley is currently on North American tour doing live dates and press in support of the project including a recent joint performance in NY City with John Mayer at the Housing Works Benefit in Soho.\n\nDiscography\n1995 - Kelley Hunt\n2000 - Inspiration\n2004 - New Shade of Blue\n2008 - Mercy User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Led Zeppelin": {
    "bio": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of Robert Plant on vocals, Jimmy Page on guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards, and John Bonham on drums. Known for a heavy, guitar-based sound that drew from blues and folk traditions, they are widely regarded as a major influence on the development of hard rock and heavy metal. They became one of the best-selling music artists in history and helped shape album-oriented rock and stadium rock.\n\nThe band evolved from the Yardbirds and initially performed under the name the New Yardbirds. After signing with Atlantic Records, they were granted significant artistic control. Although early critical reception was mixed, their commercial success grew rapidly with eight studio albums released over ten years. Their debut album, \"Led Zeppelin\" (1969), reached the top ten in several countries and included tracks such as \"Good Times Bad Times,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" and \"Communication Breakdown.\" \"Led Zeppelin II\" (1969), their first album to reach number one, featured \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On.\" \"Led Zeppelin III\" (1970) opened with \"Immigrant Song.\" Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as \"Led Zeppelin IV\" (1971), became one of the best-selling albums of all time and included \"Black Dog,\" \"Rock and Roll,\" and \"Stairway to Heaven.\" \"Houses of the Holy\" (1993) included \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"The Rain Song,\" while the double album \"Physical Graffiti\" (1975) featured \"Trampled Under Foot\" and \"Kashmir.\"\n\nPage composed most of the band's music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones made notable contributions, especially in the keyboard-focused arrangements of their later work. The second half of their career was marked by record-breaking tours and a reputation for excess. Despite continued commercial success, their activity slowed in the late 1970s, during which they released \"Presence\" (1976) and \"In Through the Out Door\" (1979). Following Bonham's death in 1980, the band disbanded. The surviving members reunited for select performances, including the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert with Jason Bonham on drums.\n\nLed Zeppelin are estimated to have sold between 200 and 300 million records worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive number-one albums in the United Kingdom and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five albums certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. Rolling Stone described them as the heaviest band of all time, the biggest band of the seventies, and one of the most enduring groups in rock history. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, where they were credited as being as influential in the 1970s as the Beatles were in the 1960s.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin\n\nStudio albums\nLed Zeppelin (1969)\nLed Zeppelin II (1969)\nLed Zeppelin III (1970)\nUntitled album (1971) (commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV)\nHouses of the Holy (1973)\nPhysical Graffiti (1975)\nPresence (1976)\nIn Through the Out Door (1979)\nCoda (1982) User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Lee Clayton": {
    "bio": "Lee Clayton (born October 29, 1942 in Russellville, Alabama, United States) is a country musician and composer.\n\nHis style has been described as in between rock and country. Clayton grew up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and began to play harmonica and guitar at the age of 7. At 9 he received his first steel guitar.\n\nAfter quitting the Air Force he moved to Nashville in 1968 and began his career as a songwriter. His first success was the song \"Ladies Love Outlaws\" which became a Number 11 hit in the Billboard Charts by Waylon Jennings in 1972. The country music style outlaw country was derived from that song. In 1973 he released his first album simply titled Lee Clayton, with which, as Clayton would later say, he was very dissatisfied. In the following years he continued his songwriting. He wrote songs like \"Lone Wolf\" for Jerry Jeff Walker or \"If You Could Touch Her at All\" for Willie Nelson. In 1978 his second album, Border Affair, was released. It was critically acclaimed but became a flop at the charts.\n\nHis most successful album was 1979's Naked Child. The songs' style was reminiscent of Bob Dylan and the single, \"I Ride Alone\", became very notable. In 1979, he went on a big world tour which became a huge success. In 1981 he released his last studio album, The Dream Goes On, which had a harder sound than his previous work. After that he published two autobiographical books and, in 1990, released a live album entitled Another Night which was recorded in Oslo. Also in 1990, The Highwaymen, an outlaw country supergroup comprising Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, had a minor hit with a song of his, \"Silver Stallion\", which had previously appeared on Border Affair. In 1994 he released the album Spirit of the twilight. Indie artist Cat Power also covered \"Silver Stallion\" on the popular 2008 cover album Jukebox. Today Clayton's career has largely gone silent.\n\nA music video was released in 2008 on Youtube of Lee Clayton performing a song entitled \"We The People,\" expressing Clayton's political views, this being the first that has been heard of Clayton since Spirit of the twilight.

  "Leon Russell": {
    "bio": "Leon Russell (Claude Russell Bridges, April 2, 1942 - November 13, 2016) was an American musician and songwriter, who has recorded as a session musician, sideman, and maintained a solo career in music.\n\nBorn in Lawton, Oklahoma, United States, Russell began playing piano at the age of four. He attended Will Rogers High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Also at Will Rogers High School were Anita Bryant, who was one year older, and in the same 1959 class, David Gates. Russell and Gates played and recorded together as the Fencement. Another student at Will Rogers during this time was Elvin Bishop, although he was a few years younger than the previously mentioned. During this time Russell was already performing at Tulsa nightclubs. After moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s, he became a session musician, working as a pianist on the recordings of many notable 1960s musical artists. By the late 1960s, Russell diversified, becoming successful as an arranger and songwriter. By 1970, he had graduated to solo recording artist, although he never ended his previous roles within the music industry. After performing country music under the name Hank Wilson in the 1970s and 1980s, Russell had largely faded into obscurity. He re-emerged in 2010 when Elton John called on him to record an album that became The Union. The album brought renewed popularity to Russell who has since released a solo album and toured around the world.\n\nRussell was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on March 14, 2011. In June, 2011, Leon Russell was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nKnown as a session musician and artist in his own right, Russell has played with artists as varied as Jerry Lee Lewis, Phil Spector and The Rolling Stones. With a solo career spanning the genres of rock, blues, and gospel, Russell began his musical career at 14, lying about his age to land a gig playing backup at a Tulsa nightclub to play with Ronnie Hawkins behind Jerry Lee Lewis. Two years later, after settling in Los Angeles, he studied guitar with James Burton, and worked sessions with Dorsey Burnette and Glen Campbell.\n\nAfter becoming a part of Phil Spector's studio group, Russell played backup on many of the most popular hits of the 1960s, including The Byrds, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, and Herb Alpert. He also served as Snuff Garrett's assistant on numerous productions. Russell built his own recording studio in 1967, and recorded his first LP, Look Inside the Asylum Choir, in a collaboration with Marc Benno.\n\nHis first songwriting hit was Joe Cocker's 1970 cover of \"Delta Lady\", and Russell went on to organise Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour. Shortly thereafter, Russell released another solo album, Leon Russell, which included the original version of the popular \"A Song for You\". Also in 1970, Russell played piano on Dave Mason's album, Alone Together (notably, on the song \"Sad and Deep as You\").\n\nDuring the 60's and 70's, Russell had a large mansion home in Tulsa near Woodward Park and was much an attraction for teenagers growing up in Tulsa. He also owned the infamous Church Recording Studio on 3rd street there, a meeting place for Russell and many friends. The Church Studio is now owned by Glen Mitchell and one-time Russell studio engineer Steve Ripley of the country band The Tractors. Russell still records there frequently.\n\nRussell also owned a large home on Grand Lake, in northeast Oklahoma. It stills stands near Dripping Springs, remodeled now, but a fond reminder of the days gone by for the now-grown kids in Oklahoma. At one time, it stood to be one of the largest homes on the lake. The home is now owned by Tulsa chiropractor and Leon Russell enthusiast Dr. F.J. Huskey. The home still contains the famous dining room table and chairs made from church pews from his Church Studio. On the property stands a private recording studio that has seen many famous names, including members of The Beatles.\n\nIn 1971, Russell appeared at George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh (performing a memorable medley of the songs \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and \"Young Blood\"), after recording sessions with B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and Bob Dylan, and went on to tour with the Rolling Stones. After focusing increasingly on his solo career, his album Carney reached #2 on the charts, although the two following albums were not received as well.\n\nDuring the 70's, Russell continued to pop in occasionally and perform in Tulsa at the Paradise Club and other noted music spots around town. He surprised his fans one night performing with Flash Eddy and the Eclectics at the Paradise.\nHis 1975 album Will O'the Wisp was fairly commercially successful, as was its single \"Lady Blue\". Gailard Sartain, fondly remembered by Tulsans as Mezeppa Pompazoidi (a Saturday night movie host, joined many times by Gary Busey), did the artwork for Russell's Will 'O the Wisp LP cover.\n\nLater that year, Russell married Mary McCreary, a former member of Sly & the Family Stone's background vocal group Little Sister. The two collaborated on The Wedding Album in 1976, and Russell penned \"This Masquerade\", which earned a Grammy Award for George Benson. In 1977, Russell and McCreary reunited for another album, and in 1979 Russell worked on a collaboration with Willie Nelson. He spent the next two years touring with the New Grass Revival, and released two more albums with Paradise before the label folded. For several years, he stayed largely out of the music spotlight, releasing Anything Can Happen in 1992, and then releasing two more albums in 1998 and 1999. Russell continues to tour at the age of 71. His bassist, Jack Wessel, has been with Russell close to 25 years. His son with McCreary, Teddy Jack (named after Gary Busey's character on Sartain's show), has also toured with his dad, as well as sisters, Tina Rose and Sugaree.\nPixies vocalist Black Francis credits Russell with influencing his vocal style: \"I realize there's a certain kind of vocalizing I do that takes its cue from Leon Russell. He sang in a southern accent but it was very blown-out and exaggerated, very free and loose.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Russell User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Leonard Cohen": {
    "bio": "Leonard Norman Cohen (September 21, 1934 – November 7, 2016) was a Canadian songwriter  poet, singer, and novelist. His work explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and romantic relationships. Cohen was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.\n\nCohen pursued a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s; he did not launch a music career until 1967, at the age of 33. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967), was followed by three more albums of folk music: Songs from a Room (1969), Songs of Love and Hate (1971) and New Skin for the Old Ceremony (1974). His 1977 record Death of a Ladies' Man, co-written and produced by Phil Spector, was a move away from Cohen's previous minimalist sound. In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional Recent Songs, which blended his acoustic style with jazz, Oriental, and Mediterranean influences. Perhaps Cohen's most famous song, \"Hallelujah\", was first released on his studio album Various Positions in 1984. I'm Your Man in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions and remains his most popular album. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, The Future, which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.\n\nCohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of Ten New Songs, which was a major hit in Canada and Europe. His 11th album, Dear Heather, followed in 2004. Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, Cohen released three albums in the final four years of his life: Old Ideas (2012), Popular Problems (2014) and You Want It Darker (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death. \n\nLeonard Cohen was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Westmount, Quebec, on September 21, 1934. His Lithuanian mother, Marsha Klonitsky (\"Masha\"; 1905–1978), was the daughter of a Talmudic writer, Rabbi Solomon Klonitsky-Kline, and emigrated to Canada in 1927. His paternal grandfather, whose family had moved from Poland to Canada, was Lyon Cohen, the founding president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. His father, Nathan Bernard Cohen (1891–1943), who owned a substantial clothing store, died when Cohen was nine years old. The family observed Orthodox Judaism, and belonged to Congregation Shaar Hashomayim, to which Cohen retained connections for the rest of his life. On the topic of being a Kohen, Cohen told Richard Goldstein in 1967, \"I had a very Messianic childhood. I was told I was a descendant of Aaron, the high priest.\"\n\nCohen attended Roslyn Elementary School and completed grades seven through nine at Herzliah High School, where his literary mentor Irving Layton taught, then transferred in 1948 to Westmount High School, where he studied music and poetry. He became especially interested in the poetry of Federico García Lorca. Cohen involved himself actively beyond Westmount's curriculum, in photography, on the yearbook staff, as a cheerleader, in the arts and current events clubs, and even served in the position of president of the Students' Council while \"heavily involved in the school's theater program\". During that time, Cohen taught himself to play the acoustic guitar, and formed a country–folk group that he called the Buckskin Boys. After a young Spanish guitar player taught him \"a few chords and some flamenco\", Cohen switched to a classical guitar. He has attributed his love of music to his mother, who sang songs around the house: \"I know that those changes, those melodies, touched me very much. She would sing with us when I took my guitar to a restaurant with some friends; my mother would come, and we'd often sing all night.\n\nCohen frequented Saint Laurent Boulevard for fun and ate at such places as the Main Deli Steak House. According to journalist David Sax, Cohen and one of his cousins would go to the Main Deli to \"watch the gangsters, pimps, and wrestlers dance around the night\". Cohen enjoyed the formerly raucous bars of Old Montreal as well as Saint Joseph's Oratory, which had the restaurant nearest to Westmount, for him and his friend Mort Rosengarten to share coffee and cigarettes. When Cohen left Westmount, he purchased a place on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, in the previously working-class neighbourhood of Little Portugal. He would read his poetry at assorted nearby clubs. In that period and that place, Cohen wrote the lyrics to some of his most famous songs. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Link Wray": {
    "bio": "Fred Lincoln \"Link\" Wray, Jr. (May 2, 1929 – November 5, 2005) was a Native American  rock and roll guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist who became popular in the late 1950s.\n\nBuilding on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records, his 1958 instrumental hit \"Rumble\" by Link Wray and his Ray Men popularized \"the power chord, the major modus operandi of modern rock guitarists\", facilitating the emergence of \"punk and heavy rock\". Rolling Stone placed Wray at No. 45 of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. In 2013 he was a nominee for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though he began in country music, his musical style went on to consist primarily of rock and roll, rockabilly, and instrumental rock.\n\nWray was born on May 2, 1929 in Dunn, North Carolina, to Fred Lincoln Wray, Sr. and his wife, Lillian M. Wray (née Coats). They were Shawnee Native Americans. Three songs he performed were named for American Indian tribes: \"Shawnee\", \"Apache\", and \"Comanche\". \"Apache\" was an instrumental composed by Jerry Lordan; it was originally a hit in the United Kingdom for The Shadows in 1960. Wray recorded a cover version 30 years later, when it was also associated with The Ventures and the Incredible Bongo Band.\n\nWray served in the US Army during the Korean War, and contracted tuberculosis, which laid him up in a hospital for a year. His stay concluded with the removal of a lung, which doctors predicted would mean he would never be able to sing again.\n\nIn 1958, Wray's first hit, \"Rumble\", was banned in New York and Boston for fear it would incite teenage gang violence. The record was first released on Cadence Records as Cat # 1347 (as Link Wray and the Ray-Men). Before, during, and after his stints with major labels Epic and Swan, Wray released 45's under many names. Tiring of the corporate music machine, he began recording albums using a three-track studio he converted from an outbuilding on his brother's property that his father used to raise chickens.\n\nWhile living in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1970s, Wray was introduced to Quicksilver Messenger Service guitarist John Cipollina by bassist James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson. He subsequently formed a band initially featuring special guest Cipollina along with the rhythm section from Cipollina's band Copperhead, bassist James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson, and drummer David Weber. They opened for the band Lighthouse at The Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles from May 15–19, 1974. He later did numerous concerts and radio broadcasts in the Bay Area including KSAN (FM) and the Bill Graham venue Winterland Ballroom, with Les Lizama later replacing Hutchinson on bass. He toured and recorded two albums with retro-rockabilly artist Robert Gordon in the late 1970s. The 1980s to the present day saw a large number of reissues as well as new material. One member of his band in the 1980s, drummer Anton Fig, later became drummer in the CBS Orchestra on the Late Show with David Letterman. In 1994, he played on four songs of the album Chatterton by French rocker Alain Bashung.\n\nWray's first three marriages—to Elizabeth Canady Wray, Katherine Tidwell Wray, and Sharon Wray—each ended in divorce. Although Wray had eight children with his first three wives, he had little contact with any of them after relocating to Denmark in the early 1980s.\n\nWray died of heart failure at his home in Copenhagen, at the age of 76. Survivors included his fourth wife, Olive Julie Povlsen Wray, and their son. He was buried in the crypt of the Christian's Church, Copenhagen.\n\nJack Rose cited Wray as an influence, as did Iggy Pop and Neil Young. Jimmy Page says that Link Wray had a \"real rebel attitude\" and credits him in It Might Get Loud as a major influence in his early career. According to Rolling Stone, Pete Townshend of The Who once said, \"If it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble,' I never would have picked up a guitar.\" \"The only people I ever really looked up to were Link Wray and Iggy Pop,\" said Mark E. Smith of The Fall. \"Guys like…Link Wray… are very special to me. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Little Eva": {
    "bio": "Eva Narcissus Boyd (June 29, 1943 – April 10, 2003), known by the stage name of Little Eva, was an American pop singer.\n\nBorn in Belhaven, North Carolina, she moved to the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, New York, at a young age.  Although some sources claim that her stage name was inspired by a character from the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, she stated in an interview that she was named after her aunt, which prompted her family to call her \"Little Eva.\" As a teenager, she worked as a maid and earned extra money as a babysitter for songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin. It is often claimed that Goffin and King were amused by Boyd's particular dancing style, so they wrote \"The Loco-Motion\" for her and had her record it as a demo (the record was intended for Dee Dee Sharp).\n\nHowever, as King said in an interview with NPR and in her \"One to One\" concert video, they knew she could sing when they met her, and it would be just a matter of time before they would have her record songs they wrote, the most successful being \"The Loco-Motion.\"\n\nMusic producer Don Kirshner of Dimension Records was impressed by the song and Boyd's voice and had it released. The song reached #1 in the United States in 1962. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. After the success of \"The Loco-Motion,\" Boyd was stereotyped as a dance-craze singer and was given limited material.\n\nThe same year, Goffin and King wrote \"He Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss)\" (performed by the Crystals) after discovering that Boyd was being regularly beaten by her boyfriend. When they inquired why she tolerated such treatment, Eva replied without batting an eyelid that her boyfriend's actions were motivated by his love for her.\n\nPhil Spector's arrangement of the song was ominous and ambiguous.\n\nIt was a brutal song, as any attempt to justify such violence must be, and Spector's arrangement only amplified its savagery, framing Barbara Alston's lone vocal amid a sea of caustic strings and funereal drums, while the backing vocals almost trilled their own belief that the boy had done nothing wrong. In more ironic hands (and a more understanding age), 'He Hit Me' might have passed at least as satire. But Spector showed no sign of appreciating that, nor did he feel any need to. No less than the song's writers, he was not preaching, he was merely documenting.\n\nBoyd's other single recordings were \"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby,\" \"Let's Turkey Trot,\" and a remake of the Bing Crosby standard \"Swinging on a Star,\" recorded with Big Dee Irwin (though Boyd was not credited on the label). Boyd also recorded the song \"Makin' With the Magilla\" for an episode of the 1964 Hanna-Barbera cartoon series The Magilla Gorilla Show.\n\nShe continued to tour and record throughout the sixties, but her commercial potential plummeted after 1964. She retired from the music industry in 1971. She never owned the rights to her recordings. Although the prevailing rumor in the 1970s was that she had received only $50 for \"The Loco-Motion,\" it seems $50 was actually her weekly salary at the time she made her records (an increase of $15 from what Goffin and King had been paying her as nanny). Penniless, she returned with her three young children to North Carolina, where they lived in obscurity.\n\nInterviewed in 1988 after the success of the Kylie Minogue cover version of \"The Loco-Motion\", Boyd stated that she did not like the new version; however its then-current popularity allowed her to make a comeback in show business.\n\nShe returned to live performing with other artists of her era on the cabaret and oldies circuits. She also occasionally recorded new songs.\n\nThe only existing footage of Little Eva performing \"Loco-Motion\" is a small clip from the ABC sixties live show Shindig! where she sang a short version of the clip along with the famous dance steps. She also sang \"Let's Turkey Trot\" and the Exciters' song \"I Want You to Be My Boy\" in the same episode. This TV show was one of her final performances until 1988, when she began performing in concerts with Bobby Vee and other singers. In a 1991 Richard Nader concert, she performed \"Loco-Motion\" and \"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\". The concert was partially documented on videotape, albeit of marginal quality.\n\nShe continued performing until she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2001. She died on April 10, 2003 in Kinston, North Carolina, at the age of 59, and is buried in a small cemetery in Belhaven, North Carolina. Her gravesite was sparsely marked until July 2008, when a report by WRAL-TV of Raleigh, North Carolina highlighted deteriorating conditions at the cemetery and efforts by the city of Belhaven to have it restored. A simple white cross had marked the site until a new gravestone was unveiled in November of that year. Her new grey gravestone has the image of a steam locomotive prominently engraved on the front and the epitaph reads: \"Singing with the Angels\".

    "bio": "Los Lobos are a Mexican-American  rock band from East Los Angeles, California, USA, heavily influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country music, folk, blues, and traditional Spanish / Mexican music such as boleros and norteño.\n\nVocalist/guitarist David Hidalgo and drummer Louie Pérez met at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, and bonded over their mutual affinity for obscure musical acts such as Fairport Convention, Randy Newman and Ry Cooder. Pérez recalls, \"We’re looking at each other, 'You like this stuff? I thought I was the only weird one.' So I went over to his house one day for about a year, which we spent listening to records, playing guitars, and starting to write songs.\" The two borrowed reel-to-reel recorders from a friend and created multi-track recordings of music spanning from parody songs to free-form jazz. They later enlisted fellow students Cesar Rosas and Conrad Lozano to complete the group's line-up in 1973.\n\nFormed in the late 1970's, band members Dave Hidalgo, Cesar Rojas, Steve Berlin, Louie Pérez and Conrad Lozano became the bellwether for Mexican-American music in the U.S. when they recorded the music for \"La Bamba\" in 1987, which added popular acclaim to the critical praise they had received for their 1984 album \"How Will the Wolf Survive?\".\n\nThey have since become one of the mainstays of the Latin music scene as well as rock music in general, staying together through over 20 albums, and for almost three decades, through changing music climate and personal tragedies, they've continued cranking out albums and touring to dedicated fans.

  "Lowell Fulson": {
    "bio": "Lowell Fulson (March 31, 1921 – March 7, 1999) was a big-voiced blues guitarist and songwriter, in the West Coast blues tradition. Fulson was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He also recorded for business reasons as Lowell Fullsom and Lowell Fulsom. After T-Bone Walker, Fulson was the most important figure in West Coast blues in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nAccording to some sources, Fulson was born on a Choctaw reservation in Oklahoma. Fulson has stated that he is of Cherokee ancestry through his father, but he has also claimed Choctaw ancestry. At the age of eighteen, Fulson moved to Ada, Oklahoma, and joined Alger \"Texas\" Alexander for a few months in 1940, but later moved to California, forming a band which soon included a young Ray Charles and tenor saxophone player, Stanley Turrentine. He recorded for Swing Time in the 1940s, Chess Records (Checker Records) in the 1950s, Kent Records in the 1960s, and Rounder Records (Bullseye) in the 1970s.\n\n\"Reconsider Baby\" came from a long term pact inked with Chess Records in 1954. It was cut in Dallas under Stan Lewis' supervision with a saxophone section that included David \"Fathead\" Newman on tenor and Leroy Cooper on baritone.\n\nJackie Brenston played in Fulson's band between 1952 and 1954.\n\nFulson stayed with Checker into 1962, but a change of record labels worked wonders when he jumped over to the Los Angeles based, Kent Records. 1965's driving \"Black Nights\" became his first hit in a decade, and \"Tramp,\" did even better, restoring the guitarist to R&B stardom.\n\nFulson was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1993  and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album. His \"Reconsider Baby\" was chosen by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".\n\nIn 1993 at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California a show entitled \"California Blues - Swingtime Tribute\" opened with Fulson plus Johnny Otis, Charles Brown, Jay McShann, Jimmy Witherspoon, Jimmy McCracklin and Earl Brown.\n\nA resident of Los Angeles, Fulson died in Long Beach, California in March 1999, at the age of 77. His companion Tina Mayfield stated that the causes of death were complications from kidney disease, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. He was the father of four and grandfather of thirteen.\n\nFulson was interred in Inglewood Park Cemetery, in Inglewood, California.\n\n\nLowell Fulson recorded every shade of blues imaginable. Polished urban blues, rustic two-guitar duets with his younger brother Martin, funk-tinged grooves that pierced the mid-'60s charts, even an unwise cover of the Beatles' \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road!\" Clearly, the veteran guitarist, who was active for more than half a century, wasn't afraid to experiment. Perhaps that's why his last couple of discs for Rounder were so vital and satisfying — and why he remained an innovator for so long. \n\nExposed to the western swing of Bob Wills as well as indigenous blues while growing up in Oklahoma, Fulson joined up with singer Texas Alexander for a few months in 1940, touring the Lone Star state with the veteran bluesman. Fulson was drafted in 1943. The Navy let him go in 1945; after a few months back in Oklahoma, he was off to Oakland, CA, where he made his first 78s for fledgling producer Bob Geddins. Soon enough, Fulson was fronting his own band and cutting a stack of platters for Big Town, Gilt Edge, Trilon, and Down Town (where he hit big in 1948 with \"Three O'Clock Blues,\" later covered by B.B. King). \n\nSwing Time records prexy Jack Lauderdale snapped up Fulson in 1948, and the hits really began to flow: the immortal \"Every Day I Have the Blues\" (an adaptation of Memphis Slim's \"Nobody Loves Me\"), \"Blue Shadows,\" the two-sided holiday perennial \"Lonesome Christmas,\" and a groovy mid-tempo instrumental \"Low Society Blues\" that really hammers home how tremendously important pianist Lloyd Glenn and alto saxist Earl Brown were to Fulson's maturing sound (all charted in 1950!). \n\nFulson toured extensively from then on, his band stocked for a time with dazzling pianist Ray Charles (who later covered Lowell's \"Sinner's Prayer\" for Atlantic) and saxist Stanley Turrentine. After a one-off session in New Orleans in 1953 for Aladdin, Fulson inked a longterm pact with Chess in 1954. His first single for the firm was the classic \"Reconsider Baby,\" cut in Dallas under Stan Lewis's supervision with a sax section that included David \"Fathead\" Newman on tenor and Leroy Cooper on baritone.\n\nThe relentless mid-tempo blues proved a massive hit and perennial cover item — even Elvis Presley cut it in 1960, right after he got out of the Army. But apart from \"Loving You,\" the guitarist's subsequent Checker output failed to find widespread favor with the public. Baffling, since Fulson's crisp, concise guitar work and sturdy vocals were as effective as ever. Most of his Checker sessions were held in Chicago and L.A. (the latter his home from the turn of the '50s). \n\nFulson stayed with Checker into 1962, but a change of labels worked wonders when he jumped over to Los Angeles-based Kent Records. 1965's driving \"Black Nights\" became his first smash in a decade, and \"Tramp,\" a loping funk-injected workout co-written by Fulson and Jimmy McCracklin, did even better, restoring the guitarist to R&B stardom, gaining plenty of pop spins, and inspiring a playful Stax cover by Otis Redding and Carla Thomas only a few months later that outsold Fulson's original. \n\nA couple of lesser follow-up hits for Kent ensued before the guitarist was reunited with Stan Lewis at Jewel Records. That's where he took a crack at that Beatles number, though most of his outings for the firm were considerably closer to the blues bone. Fulson was never been absent for long on disc; 1992's Hold On and its 1995 follow-up Them Update Blues, both for Ron Levy's Bullseye Blues logo, were among his later efforts, both quite solid. Fulson continued to perform until 1997, when health problems forced the career bluesman into a reluctant retirement. His health continued to deteriorate and on March 6, 1999 - just a few weeks shy of his 78th birthday - Lowell Fulson passed away.\n\nFew bluesmen managed to remain contemporary the way Lowell Fulson did for more than five decades. And fewer still will make such a massive contribution to the idiom. \n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Lucinda Williams": {
    "bio": "Lucinda Williams (born January 26, 1953) is an American rock, folk, and alt-country songwriter and singer. A three-time Grammy Award winner, she was named \"America's best songwriter\" by TIME magazine in 2002.\n\nWilliams has garnered considerable critical acclaim but her commercial success has been moderate. She has a reputation as a perfectionist and as a slow worker when it comes to recording; six years passed between the release of her second and third albums.  However, she frequently makes guest appearances on other artists' albums and contributes to compilations and soundtracks. She has recorded with Elvis Costello, Nanci Griffith, John Prine, Leftover Salmon, and Steve Earle, among others.  She has also opened concerts for artists such as Neil Young.\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliams was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the daughter of poet and literature professor Miller Williams. Her father worked as a visiting professor in Mexico and Chile as well as different parts of the American South, before settling at the University of Arkansas. His daughter showed an affinity for music at an early age, and was playing guitar at 12.\n\nCareer\n\nBy her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in Austin, Texas and Houston, Texas, concentrating on a folk-rock-country blend. She moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1978 to record her first album, for Smithsonian/Folkways Records. Titled Ramblin', it was a collection of country and blues covers. She followed it up in 1980 with Happy Woman Blues, which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.\n\nIn the 1980s Williams moved to Los Angeles, California (before finally settling in Nashville, TN), where -- performing both backed by a rock band and in acoustic settings -- she developed a following and a critical reputation. Nevertheless, it was not until 1988 that Rough Trade Records released the self-titled Lucinda Williams. The single \"Changed the Locks\", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including Tom Petty, who would later cover the song.\n\nIts follow-up, Sweet Old World (Chameleon, 1992), was a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams's biggest success during the early '90s was as a songwriter. Mary Chapin Carpenter recorded a cover of \"Passionate Kisses\" (from Lucinda Williams) in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1994.\n\nWilliams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. Emmylou Harris said of Williams, \"She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is. But, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop. And I feel strongly that that's country music's loss.\"\n\nWilliams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.\n\nThe long-awaited release, 1998's Car Wheels on a Gravel Road was Williams' breakthrough to the mainstream. Containing the single \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" from the Robert Redford film The Horse Whisperer, the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. It received a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. She toured with Bob Dylan and on her own in support of the album.\n\nWilliams followed up the success of Car Wheels with Essence (2001). This release featured a less produced, more stripped-down approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Female Rock performance for the single \"Get Right With God\", an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release. The title track was co-written and co-recorded with alternative country musician Ryan Adams.\n\nHer seventh album, World Without Tears, was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.\n\nIn 2006, Lucinda recorded a version of the John Hartford classic \"Gentle On My Mind,\" which played over the closing credits of the Will Ferrell filmTalladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby\n\nWilliams was a guest vocalist on the song \"Factory Girls\" from Irish punk-folk band Flogging Molly's 2004 album, \"Within a Mile of Home\", and appeared on Elvis Costello's The Delivery Man. She duetted with Steve Earle on the song \"You're Still Standin' There\" from his album I Feel Alright from 1996.\n\nWilliams released the album \"West\" on February 13, 2007, to mostly good reviews. The material is highly personal, chronicling the death of her mother and the breakup of a turbulent relationship.\n\nLucinda released her ninth studio album, \"Little Honey\", on October 14th.

  "Madeleine Peyroux": {
    "bio": "Madeleine Peyroux is a jazz singer who was born in 1974 in Athens, Georgia, USA, and raised in New York City and Paris, France. She is noted for her vocal style, which is highly reminiscent of Billie Holiday. Madeleine also has qualities similar to Ella Fitzgerald. Though Peyroux may remind some listeners of Holiday, there are differences, and she has her own sense of phrasing and interpretation.\n\nPeyroux started singing at the age of fifteen, when she discovered street musicians in the Latin Quarter in Paris. She joined a group called the Riverboat Shufflers, first passing round the hat, and then singing. At sixteen she joined the The Lost Wandering Blues and Jazz Band, spending two years touring Europe performing songs by the likes of Fats Waller, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and others, which provided the basis for her first album, Dreamland.\n\nDreamland was released in 1996, and gained widespread attention. Time called it \"the most exciting, involving vocal performance by a new singer this year\". Dreamland, is a brilliant recording, as Peyroux's distinctive voice is not hindered by overly intricate arrangements. Most of the accompaniment on the record is light and sparse, the way it should be for a singer with such a unique voice. Peyroux soon found herself opening for Sarah McLachlan and Cesária Évora, and made appearances at jazz festivals and on the Lilith Fair tour.\n\nIn May 2002 she joined multi-instrumentalist William Galison, and together they appeared at such venues as the Bottom Line, Joe's Pub, and the Tin Angel. In 2003 the duo released a seven-song EP entitled Got You on My Mind, which they sold at shows and online. Got You on My Mind was re-released by William Galison in August 2004; the original EP was expanded by the addition of four tracks by Gallison.\n\nPeyroux released her own sophomore effort, Careless Love, in September 2004. The album received generally positive reviews.\n\nHer new album, Half the Perfect World, was released on September 12, 2006. She collaborated with several artists, including Jesse Harris, Walter Becker, Larry Klein (who also produced the album), and K.d. lang, with whom Peyroux duets on a cover of the Joni Mitchell song, \"River\".\n\nOn July 12, 2007, she was awarded Best International Jazz Artist at the BBC Jazz Awards.\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Mahalia Jackson": {
    "bio": "Mahalia Jackson (October 26, 1911 – January 27, 1972) was an American gospel singer. Possessing a powerful contralto voice, she was referred to as \"The Queen of Gospel\". Jackson became one of the most influential gospel singers in the world and was heralded internationally as a singer and civil rights activist. She was described by entertainer Harry Belafonte as \"the single most powerful black woman in the United States\". She recorded about 30 albums (mostly for Columbia Records) during her career, and her 45 rpm records included a dozen \"golds\"—million-sellers.\n\"I sing God's music because it makes me feel free,\" Jackson once said about her choice of gospel, adding, \"It gives me hope. With the blues, when you finish, you still have the blues.\"\n\nJackson grew up in the \"Black Pearl\" section of the Carrollton neighbourhood of uptown New Orleans, Louisiana, and began singing in a Baptist church. In 1927 she moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she sang with The Johnson Brothers, one of the earliest professional gospel groups.\n\nThe Johnson Brothers broke up in the mid-1930s, and Jackson began her solo career, recording for Decca in 1937. The result, \"God's Gonna Separate the Wheat from the Tares\", was only a moderate success, but Jackson became a popular concert draw. She didn't record again untill 1946, when she signed with Apollo Records, releasing several singles that are now highly regarded, though sales were sluggish at the time. \"Move On up a Little Higher\" (1948) became a huge success, however, and stores could not stock enough of it to meet demand. Jackson rocketed to fame in the U.S. and soon afterwards in Europe. \"I Can Put My Trust in Jesus\" won a prize from the French Academy, and \"Silent Night\" was one of the best-selling singles in the history of Norway. She began a radio series on CBS and signed to Columbia Records in 1954. With her mainstream success came an inevitable backlash from gospel purists who felt she had watered down her sound for popular accessibility.\n\nJackson's career in the late 1950s and early 1960s continued to rise when she recorded with Percy Faith, and performed at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival and the inauguration of John F. Kennedy. She also sang at the funeral of her friend Martin Luther King, Jr. The late 1960s saw a downturn in her popular success. She ended her career with a concert in Germany in 1971; when she returned, she made one of her final television appearances on The Flip Wilson Show.\n\nJackson died in Chicago on 27th January 1972 of heart failure and diabetes at the age of sixty. She was buried in Providence Memorial Park in Metairie, Louisiana. She was posthumously inducted into the Gospel Music Association's Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "Maria Muldaur (born Maria Grazia Rosa Domenica D'Amato; September 12, 1943 in Greenwich Village, New York) is an American folk-blues singer who was part of the American folk music revival in the early 1960s. She is probably best known for her 1974 hit song \"Midnight at the Oasis\". She continues to record albums in the folk-blues tradition.\n\nBorn Maria Garzia Rosa Domenica d'Amato on 12th September 1943 in Greenwich Village, New York, she performed in the early 1960s in Greenwich Village with Bob Dylan, John Sebastian, David Grisman, and Stefan Grossman. Later in the 1960s her distinctive vocals were heard in many of the tracks recorded by Jim Kweskin & the Jug Band. \n\nShe began her solo career in 1972 when her marriage to fellow Jug Band member Geoff Muldaur  ended, retaining her married name. Her first solo album \"Maria Muldaur\", released in 1973, contained her hit single \"Midnight at the Oasis\", which reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. It also peaked at number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. Later that year, she released her second album Waitress In A Donut Shop. This included a re-recording of \"I'm a Woman\", the Leiber and Stoller number first associated with Peggy Lee and a standout feature from her Jug Band days. The title of this album is taken from a line in another song on the album, \"Sweetheart\" by Ken Burgan.\n\nAround this time, Muldaur established a relationship with the Grateful Dead. Opening for some Grateful Dead shows in the summer of 1974, with John Kahn, bassist of the Jerry Garcia Band, would eventually earn her a seat in that group in the late 1970s, as a backing vocalist.\n\nLater in her career, as her voice deepened, the blues were featured in more of her recordings. Her 2005 release Sweet Lovin' Ol' Soul was nominated for both a W.C. Handy Award and a Grammy award in the Traditional Blues Category.\n\nIn 2011 she released the album \"Steady Love\".

He scored numerous hits during the 1960s, among them \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\", and \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\", as well as several hit duets with Tammi Terrell, including \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"\" and \"You're All I Need to Get By\", before moving on to his own form of musical self-expression.\n\nAlong with Stevie Wonder, Gaye is notable for fighting the hit-making—but creatively restrictive—Motown record-making process, in which performers, songwriters and record producers were generally kept in separate camps. Gaye forced Motown to release his 1971 album What's Going On, which is today hailed as one of the best albums of all time. Subsequent releases proved that Gaye, who had been a part-time songwriter for Motown artists during his early years with the label, could write and produce his own singles without having to rely on the Motown system. This achievement would pave the way for the successes of later self-sufficient singer-songwriter-producers in African American music, such as Luther Vandross and Babyface.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Gaye would release several other notable albums, including Let's Get It On and I Want You, and released several successful singles such as \"Come Get to This\", \"Got to Give It Up\" and \"Sexual Healing\". By the time of his shooting death in 1984, at the hands of his clergyman father, Gaye had become one of the most influential artists of the soul music era.

  "Mel Torme": {
    "bio": "Melvin Howard Tormé (1925–1999) was born to immigrant Russian Jewish parents whose name had been Torma. A child prodigy, he first sang professionally at 4 with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra, singing \"You're Driving Me Crazy,\" at Chicago's Blackhawk restaurant. 1933-41, he acted in the network radio serials \"The Romance of Helen Trent\" and \"Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy.\" He wrote his first song at 13 and three years later, his first published song, \"Lament to Love,\" became a hit recording for Harry James. He played drums in Chicago's Shakespeare Elementary School drum and bugle corps in his early teens. While a teen-ager, he sang, arranged, and played drums in a band led by Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers. His formal education ended in 1944, with his graduation from Chicago's Hyde Park High School.\n\nIn 1943, Torme made his movie debut in Frank Sinatra's first film, the musical \"Higher and Higher.\" He went on to sing and act in a number of films and television episodes throughout his career, even hosting his own television show in 1951-52. His appearance in the 1947 film musical \"Good News\" made him a teen idol for a few years. In the last years of his career he toured and sang with the wonderful George Shearing Quartet, often sitting in at drums, for a number or two in a set. To hear two such accomplished jazz artists was an evening not to be forgotten.\n\nIn that year he also formed the vocal quintet \"Mel Torme and His Mel-Tones,\" modeled after Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers. The Mel-Tones, which included Les Baxter and Ginny O'Connor, had several hits fronting Artie Shaw's band and on their own, including Cole Porter's \"What is This Thing Called Love?\" The Mel-Tones were among the first jazz-influenced vocal groups, blazing a path later followed by The Hi-Los, The Four Freshmen, and The Manhattan Transfer.\n\nIn 1947, Torme went solo. His singing at New York's Copacabana led a local DJ, Fred Robbins, to give him the nickname \"The Velvet Fog\", thinking to honor his high tenor and smooth vocal style, but Torme detested the nickname. As a solo singer, he recorded a number of romantic hits for Decca (1945), and with the Artie Shaw Orchestra on the Musicraft label (1946-48). In 1949, he moved to Capitol Records, where his first record, \"Careless Hands,\" became his only number one hit. His versions of \"Again\" and \"Blue Moon\" became signature tunes. His composition \"California Suite,\" prompted by the Gordon Jenkins's \"Manhattan Tower,\" became Capitol's first 12 inch LP. Around this time, he helped pioneer cool jazz.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1957, Torme recorded 7 jazz vocal albums with Red Clyde's Bethlehem Records, all with groups led by Marty Paich, most notably \"Mel Torme with the Marty Paich Dektette.\" These recordings proved a creative peak for Torme and for Paich, a leading figure in the West coast jazz of the time.\n\nWhen rock & roll music (which Torme called \"three chord manure\") came on the scene in the 1950s, commercial success became elusive. During the next two decades, Torme often recorded mediocre arrangements of the pop tunes of the day, never staying long with any particular label. He was sometimes forced to make his living by singing in obscure clubs. He had two minor hits, his 1956 recording of \"Mountain Greenery,\" and his 1962 R&B song \"Comin' Home, Baby,\" arranged by Claus Ogerman. The latter recording led the jazz and gospel singer Ethel Waters to say that \"Torme is the only white man who sings with the soul of a black man.\" It was later covered instrumentally by Quincy Jones and Kai Winding.\n\nIn 1963–64, Torme wrote songs and musical arrangements for the The Judy Garland Show, and made two guest appearances on the show itself. A few years later, after Garland's death, his time with her show became the subject of his first book, \"The Other Side of the Rainbow.\" Although the book was praised, it led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Garland's family.\n\nTorme continued to play jazz drums as an adult, and befriended drummer Buddy Rich, who became the subject of his book \"Traps-The Drum Wonder-The Life of Buddy Rich.\" Torme also owned and played a drumset that renowned drummer Gene Krupa had used for many years.\n\nAlthough a jazz and popular musician, Torme also respected classical music, especially that of Frederick Delius and Percy Grainger.\n\nThe resurgence of vocal jazz in the 1970s resulted in another artistically fertile period for Torme, whose live performances during the 1960s and 70s fueled a growing reputation as a jazz singer. He found himself performing as often as 200 times a year around the globe. In 1976, he won an Edison Award (the Dutch equivalent of the Grammy) for best male singer, and a Downbeat award for best male jazz singer. For a number of years around this time, his September appearances at Michael's Pub, on the Upper East Side would unofficially open New York's fall cabaret season.\n\nTormé viewed his 1977 Carnegie Hall concert with George Shearing and Gerry Mulligan as a turning point. Shearing later said:\n\n    \"It is impossible to imagine a more compatible musical partner… I humbly put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a year. We literally breathed together during our countless performances. As Mel put it, we were two bodies of one musical mind.\"\n\nStarting in 1982, Torme recorded a number of albums with Concord Records, including:\n\n    * Five albums with pianist George Shearing;\n    * His big band work with Rob McConnell and his Boss Brass orchestra (see Mel Torme, Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass);\n    * A reunion with Marty Paich, resulting in a live recording in Tokyo (In Concert Tokyo) and a studio album (Reunion).\n\nIn the 1980s, he often performed with pianist John Colianni. In the last years of his career he toured and sang with the wonderful George Shearing Quartet, often sitting in at drums, for a number or two in a set. To hear two such accomplished jazz artists was an evening not to be forgotten.\n\nTorme made 9 guest appearances as himself on the 1980s sitcom Night Court whose main character, Judge Harry Stone (played by Harry Anderson), was depicted as an unabashed Tormé fan. In the mid-90s, Torme gained a following among Generation Xers by appearing in a series of Mountain Dew commercials and on an episode of the sitcom Seinfeld, in which he dedicates a song to the character Kramer (played by Michael Richards). Torme also recorded a version of Nat King Cole's \"Straighten up and Fly Right\" with his son, alternative/adult contemporary/jazz singer Steve March Torme.\n\nIn February 1999, Tormé was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. On August 8, 1996, a stroke abruptly ended his 65-year singing career; another stroke in 1999 ended his life. In his eulogistic essay, John Andrews wrote about Tormé: \"Tormé's style shared much with that of his idol, Ella Fitzgerald. Both were firmly rooted in the foundation of the swing era, but both seemed able to incorporate bebop innovations to keep their performances sounding fresh and contemporary. Like Sinatra, they sang with perfect diction and brought out the emotional content of the lyrics through subtle alterations of phrasing and harmony. Ballads were characterized by paraphrasing of the original melody which always seemed tasteful, appropriate and respectful to the vision of the songwriter. Unlike Sinatra, both Fitzgerald and Tormé were likely to cut loose during a swinging up-tempo number with several scat choruses, using their voices without words to improvise a solo like a brass or reed instrument.\"\n\nTormé wrote more than 250 songs, a number of which became jazz standards. He also often wrote the arrangements for the songs he sang. He often collaborated with Bob Wells, and the best known Tormé-Wells song is \"The Christmas Song\", often referred to by its opening line \"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.\" First recorded by Nat King Cole in 1946, it has been a holiday favorite ever since. Tormé said that he wrote the music to the song in only 40 minutes, and that it was not one of his personal favorites.\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Merle Haggard": {
    "bio": "Merle Haggard will forever be remembered as a true American treasure whose work often reflected his complicated life – his problems with the law, five marriages, six children and the complexities a life in the music business yielded.\n\nInducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1994, they said about him:\n\n“Merle Haggard stands, with the arguable exception of Hank Williams, as the single most influential singer-songwriter in country music history.”\n\nUpon his death, The New York Times agreed: “In Mr. Haggard’s case the sound defined a body of work as indelibly as that of any country singer since Hank Williams.”\n\nRolling Stone said Haggard: “composed and performed one of the greatest repertoires in country music, capturing the American condition with his stories of the poor, the lost, the working class, heartbroken and hard-living.”\n\nAnd also at that time, The Tennessean called Haggard “the working man’s poet, an architect of the Bakersfield Sound and a fiercely independent artist who influenced country music like few others.”\n\nNeedless to say, much has been written about the importance of the singer-songwriter. But If nothing had ever been reported about Haggard and we only had his music, we would still know the man, his loves, his pains, his demons and his life.\n\nHe was his own documentarian of the challenges he faced in covert autobiographical compositions such as “The Running Kind” and “Rambling Man” about his restlessness which then lead to his incarceration and many songs including “Branded Man” “Sing Me Back Home,” and “Mama Tried,” in which he announced he turned 21 in prison. Always there was love in his life and he had lots to say on the subject in such songs as “Silver Wings,” “Always Wanting You,” “Today I Started Loving You Again” and “It’s Not Love.”  Woven in there were the drinking and gambling songs chronicling more of Haggard’s troubled times.\n\nAll those troubles, though, ultimately lead Haggard to 40 songs at #1 on the Billboard Country charts, two Grammy awards and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006, multiple Country Music Association Awards and many from the Association of Country Music, not to mention the Kennedy Center Honor in 2010.\n\nHaggard confirmed in his 1981 autobiography Sing Me Back Home that prison, indeed, became part of the life experience that made him who he was as a person and creative force.\n\n“I believe I survived prison not because it taught me a lesson – though I learned a lot – but because I had to prove I could survive,” he said in the book.  “I believe I got my life together in spite of prison, maybe even in defiance of it. I will say this now, and it’ll sound strange, but prison was an experience I’m glad I had. I could have done without it, for damn sure, but for all it gave me and all it took away, I believe the score was on the plus side…”\n\nMusic was always the silver lining.\n\nIn Haggard’s book, his mother Flossie described Merle as unpredictable, but he was always a music lover. Haggard said his sister Lillian told him their mama said even before he was born, music would be his birthright. She named him Merle after a musician friend of the family.\n\nMerle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937 in Oildale, California. “No More Trains” records the boxcar that was his first home. He claims life was fairly normal until the death of his father James when Merle was just 9-years-old turned his world upside down and its crushing blow delivered far reaching results.\n\nOnce Haggard’s daddy was gone, the boy just had no use for discipline or authority and no desire to attend school.  The year after his father died, he hopped his first of many freight trains with his schoolmate Billy Thorpe, riding to Fresno. Of course they were caught.\n\nSchool may not have interested Haggard, but music definitely did.\n\nExplaining his relationship with music in his book, Haggard said, “Like a dear friend, it’s puzzled me at times, but never disappointed me. Like a good woman, it’s given me comfort and pleasure, and asked only respect and attention in return. Like a religion, it has offered me a reason for being when other things have slipped away. But most of all, it has become an extension of my feelings, allowing me that little piece of immortality everybody dreams about.”\n\nHis mother started him on violin at an early age, but Haggard, being as opinionated as he was, insisted upon learning the fiddle. It would serve him well in the future.\n\nThen when his older brother Lowell brought a beat up guitar home when Merle was 12, Merle gravitated toward the instrument. As he began to play, he noticed people paid attention and for a shy boy, he found the guitar helped give him a voice.\n\nBy age 14, Haggard had been in and out of juvenile hall several times for truancy. Out mostly, because he had escaped – another problem.  So early in 1952 he was sent to a juvenile detention center in Whittier, California called the Fred C. Nelles School for Boys, surrounded by barbed wire.\n\nAfter several escapes from Nelles, Haggard was transferred to Preston School of Industry in Stockton, serving his time out there, despite one escape.\n\nBy the mid ‘50s, Haggard was beginning to work the club scene in Bakersfield. He had married his first wife, Leona Hobbs, in 1956 and just when life seemed as if it was fairly normal, Haggard got himself arrested for one of his car “borrowing” schemes and landed in the Ventura County Jail for a year. That was 1956 and he lamented that he missed the birth of his first child, Dana.\n\nNo matter what, trouble followed Haggard and he couldn’t resist its lure. By January 1958 he had earned a place in San Quentin.\n\nIt wasn’t until Haggard slipped up there and started a beer making and gambling operation with another inmate and was put into isolation, that he had an epiphany.\n\n“Whatever it was, I came off isolation determined to do something positive for Merle Haggard,” he stated in Sing Me Back Home.\n\nHe had been denied parole once already since he had been lazy and unrepentant. He cleaned up his act quickly and applied for the toughest job in the prison – at the textile mill – and he was granted parole the next time.\n\nReleased in 1960, Haggard immediately went to work for his brother Lowell, digging ditches and wiring houses. That didn’t last very long as Merle’s musical talents began to shine through very quickly.\n\nAn opportunity to play at one of the premier local clubs, the Lucky Spot, not only liberated Haggard from his day job, but also united him in a band with Fuzzy Owen who co-owned the small record label Tally Records along with Lewis Talley. Owen and Haggard would become lifelong associates.\n\nBefore he knew it, Haggard was performing in Las Vegas, playing bass for Wynn Stewart. And that’s where he found the first song he wanted to cut. Stewart was singing his “Sing a Sad Song” one night in the Nashville Nevada Club and although Stewart had had plans to record it, Haggard convinced him to give it to him to record.\n\nThat first single went to No. 19 on the Billboard Country Charts. Simultaneously, celebrating that success, Haggard was struggling with his demons of gambling and ended up returning home to Bakersfield without a penny to his name.\n\n“You Don’t Have Very Far to Go” written with Red Simpson made the top 20 and the one after that, “My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers,” written by Liz Anderson hit No. 10.\n\nThanks to Buck Owens who made the request to cut Haggard’s own “Swinging Doors,” Merle took a good look at his own song and thought if Buck Owens wanted to record it, it must have merit. He kept it for himself and sure enough, it reached No. 5. in 1966. He was well on his way.\n\nIt was that same year Haggard formed his band, calling them The Strangers, a nod to the previous hit he had had. Between the years 1969 and 1987, they were voted Band of the Year by the Academy of Country Music Awards eight times.\n\n“I’m a Lonesome Fugitive” by Liz and Casey Anderson hit No. 1 in 1966 and by 1980 he amassed 25 No 1 records, including his very popular 1969 crossover hit “Okie From Muskogee.” By 1989 there were 40 No 1’s.\n\nBut in 1997 Haggard told Country Weekly it was his pardon from Governor Ronald Reagan on July 7, 1971 that was his greatest accomplishment. For the boy who had taken the wrong path so many times, it was an important symbol of respect.\n\n“Twelve men voted on it and unanimously gave me a pardon – the youngest man to ever receive a pardon in the state of California. I thought it was the greatest thing that could happen to me. You can receive awards, but to have those people – those hard-nosed politicians – vote yes in my favor, says somebody liked what we did,” said Haggard who was then pardoned a second time in 2009 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nAlso in 1971, he returned to San Quentin to perform for the inmates, just as Johnny Cash had when he was one, himself.\n\nHaggard told Country Weekly Magazine in 1998 what he liked most about what he did musically included his songs “Okie From Muskogee,” “Today I Started Loving You Again,” “Big City,” “Fightin’ Side of Me,” “Mama Tried,” “Workin’ Man Blues,” “Mama’s Hungry Eyes,” “Sing Me Back Home,” and even some he didn’t write like “Misery and Gin,” “All My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers,” “Down Every Road” and “The Fugitive.”\n\nIn Haggard’s later years it would be family that he valued most. He doted on the two children he had with his fifth wife Theresa Lane, despite the fact that he continued to perform to sold out audiences in over 100 shows a year. But admitting that in his earlier days he had been so caught up in his troubles and his career that he hadn’t always been the father he should have been, he set about to deepening his relationships with his older children from his previous marriages. In the last year of his life he was also able to enjoy his grandchild Delaney from Jenessa, his daughter with Theresa.\n\nBy the time of his death at age 79 on his birthday, April 6, 2016, Haggard had recorded more than 100 albums, had a star on Hollywood Blvd., had been on the cover of Time Magazine and even received an honorary doctorate in fine arts from California State University of Bakersfield. He was one of the most celebrated country music stars in the world; a true icon.\n\nIn the ’97 Country Weekly story, as Haggard was turning 60, he said he believed in predestination.\n\n“There’s a reason for everything,” he said. “The route my life took was meant to be that way in order for it to be the way it is now. It’s been incredible, and frankly, if He pulled the switch tomorrow, it’s been a great ride.” User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",
    "bioSummary": "Merle Haggard will forever be remembered as a true American treasure whose work often reflected his complicated life – his problems with the law, five marriages, six children and the complexities a life in the music business yielded.\n\nInducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1994, they said about him:\n\n“Merle Haggard stands, with the arguable exception of Hank Williams, as the single most influential singer-songwriter in country music history.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Merle+Haggard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

  "Michael Franti": {
    "bio": "Michael Franti (born April 21, 1966, in Oakland, California) is an African, Irish, and German American poet, musician, and composer. Franti is the creator and driving force behind Michael Franti & Spearhead, a band that blends hip hop with a variety of other styles including funk, reggae, folk, and rock.\n\nFranti was part of the industrial punk band The Beatnigs with DJ Rono Tse, which released a self-titled LP, and an EP Television on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles records.  His next project, The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, found Franti continuing his collaboration with Tse, and working with jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter, and electronic musicians Mark Pistel (Consolidated) and Jack Dangers (Meat Beat Manifesto). The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy wrote biting, progressive lyrics that railed against the injustice of the world and yearned for democratic reform, set to a fusion of industrial and hip hop. Their first album won acclaim for its social commentary, and they were chosen by U2 to open for their Zoo TV Tour.\n\nFranti and the Disposable Heroes put together another record of music accompanying novelist William Burroughs' readings for an album entitled Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales. This album diverged greatly from the style of the band's previous work, as they were largely providing musical background and accompaniment to Burroughs' spoken readings from several of his books.\n\nIn 1994, Franti formed a new band called Spearhead. While he continued to create politically and socially conscious lyrics, Spearhead's music drew more from funk and soul than the industrial sound of his previous groups. Spearhead released their first album, Home, in September of 1994. Their follow up album Chocolate Supa Highway was released in March of 1997. It should be noted that these two albums were released under the band name \"Spearhead\", while the name on all subsequent albums would be \"Michael Franti & Spearhead\".\n\nIn 1999, Franti retreated from the major-label grind to explore his music and politics. He returned the following year as an organizer and cultural worker tied to the rising movements against the death penalty, the prison-industrial complex and corporate globalization, voicing his observations through his music.\n\nStay Human was released in 2000 on his own indie label, Boo Boo Wax and Six Degrees. The album's themes are justice and survival, touching on issues like media monopolization and incarceration.\n\nEveryone Deserves Music was released in 2003. Franti composed many of the songs from his guitar and, like fellow 21st century cultural globalists Manu Chao and Ozomatli, continues to synthesize his eclectic influences. In a departure from the noise of the Beatnigs and Disposable Heroes, and the minimalism of early Spearhead, Franti's affirming lyrics are now set to appropriately swelling rock chords, while keeping a world-wise groove nodding towards reggae, dancehall, bossa nova, Afrobeat, and funk.\n\nOn July 25, 2006, Michael Franti & Spearhead released their new album, entitled Yell Fire!, inspired by Franti's trip to war-torn Baghdad, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.  Largely written during that trip and recorded in Jamaica, Yell Fire! contains contributions from Sly & Robby and has a more reggae-influenced vibe than previous work.\n\nMichael Franti has been barefoot since 2000.

  "Nat King Cole": {
    "bio": "Nat \"King\" Cole (March 17th 1919–February 15th  1965) was a popular American singer and jazz musician. \n\nAs a piano player, he formed a jazz trio in 1938 that played Los Angeles nightclubs, one of the first jazz trios featuring guitar and piano. Prior to this he had played music since he was a child and had worked with bands since he was sixteen. He was raised in Chicago and exposed to the abundant jazz scene there. He was heavily influenced by pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines.\n\nLater he became more popularly known as a singer and crooner and his work became more orchestrated.\n\nHis first mainstream vocal hit was in 1944 with Straighten Up and Fly Right, based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Although hardly a rocker, the song's success proved that an audience for folk-based material existed. It is considered a predecessor to the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.\n\nBeginning in the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period with such hits as The Christmas Song (1946), Nature Boy (1948), Mona Lisa (1950), and his signature tune Unforgettable (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his musical roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. In 1991, Mosaic Records released the Complete Nat King Cole Trio Recordings on Capitol, which contained 349 songs on twenty-seven LPs or eighteen CDs.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Cole continued to rack up hit after hit, including Smile, Pretend, A Blossom Fell, and If I May. Most of his pop hits were collaborations with famed arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle. It was with Riddle that Cole released his first ten-inch long-play album in 1953 entitled Sings for Two in Love. Several more albums followed, including the Gordon Jenkins arranged Love Is the Thing, which reached number one on the album charts in April 1957.\n\nInspired by a trip to Havana, Cuba in 1958, Nat went back there that same year and recorded Cole Espanol, an album sung entirely in Spanish and Portuguese. The album was a hit not only in the U.S., but in Latin America as well. The album was so popular, that two others followed: A mis amigos in 1959, and More Cole Espanol in 1962.\n\nMusical tastes were changing in the late 1950s, and despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with Send for Me, Cole's ballad singing had grown old to younger listeners. Like contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Nat found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's longtime collaborator Nelson Riddle, left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. The two parted ways with one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Nat would later re-tool the concept album into an off-Broadway production called I'm With You.\n\nAs the 1960s progressed, Nat once again found success on the American singles chart, starting with the country/pop flavored hit Ramblin' Rose in August of 1962. Three more hit singles followed: Dear Lonely Hearts, Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer, and That Sunday, That Summer. Nat's final album was entitled L.O.V.E, and was recorded in late 1964. It was released just prior to his death and reached number four on the Billboard Albums chart in the spring of 1965. A \"Best Of\" album went gold in 1968. His 1957 song When I Fall in Love was a chart topping hit for the U.K. in 1987.\n\nCole was the first African-American to have his own radio program. He repeated that success in the late-1950s with the first truly national television show starring an African-American. In both cases, the programs were ultimately canceled because sponsors shied away from a black artist. Cole fought racism all his life, refusing to perform in segregated venues. In 1956, he was attacked on stage in Birmingham, Alabama by members of the White Citizens' Council who apparently were attempting to kidnap him. Despite injuries, Cole completed the show but vowed never to perform in the South again.\n\nOn 23rd August 1956, Cole spoke at the Republican National Convention in the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California. He was also present at the Democratic National Convention in 1960, to throw his support behind President John F. Kennedy. Cole was also among the dozens of entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the Kennedy Inaugural gala in 1961. Nat King Cole frequently consulted with President Kennedy (and later President Johnson) on the issue of civil rights. Yet he was dogged by critics, who felt he shied away from controversy when it came to the civil rights issue. Among the most notable was Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was upset that Cole didn't take stronger action after the 1956 on-stage attack.\n\nIn 1948, Cole purchased a house in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. The property owners association told Cole they didn't want any undesirables moving in, to which Cole retorted \"Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I'll be the first to complain.\"\n\nHe and his second wife, Maria Ellington, were married in Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. They had five children, including twin girls. Daughter Carol Cole, and son Kelly Cole were adopted. Kelly Cole died in 1995. Nat's daughter, Natalie Cole, and his younger brother, Freddie Cole are also singers.\n\nNatalie and her father had an unexpected hit in the summer of 1991. The younger Cole mixed a 1961 recording of her father's rendition of Unforgettable with her own voice, creating an electronic duet. Both the song and the album of the same name won several Grammy awards the following year.\n\nCole performed in many short films, and played W. C. Handy in the film Saint Louis Blues. He also appeared in The Nat King Cole Story, China Gate, and The Blue Gardenia.\n\nNat King Cole was a heavy smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice the rich sound it had (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording for this very purpose). Cole died of lung cancer at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California, on 15th February 1965. His funeral was held at St. Victor's Catholic Church in West Hollywood, and he was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Cat Ballou, his final film, was released several months later. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Neil Young": {
    "bio": "Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer, guitarist, songwriter, and social activist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation, particularly as Neil Young & Crazy Horse. Young was born in Toronto, but he moved to the family home of Winnipeg as a child, which is where his music career began. Young began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay.\n\nHaving success on his own for a bit, he later joined the folk rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969, thus forming Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968. His career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles; his musical vision is notably referred to by his autobiographical tune\"The Loner\". Music critics have often called him one of the best single artists of all time, and several tunes such as \"Heart of Gold\" and \"Rockin' in the Free World\" remain popular on rock radio.\n\nAccording to the Don't Be Denied Songfacts, the 16-year-old Neil was raising chickens and selling the eggs, with plans to go to Ontario Agricultural College and be a farmer. Only his leisure activities foretold his future, when he would hide from his family problems in his room with his transistor radio playing local station CHUM. From this, Young experienced a growing admiration for rock n roll originators such as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, of course, Elvis Presley. In 1958, his father bought Neil his first music instrument, a plastic ukulele. His father would later recall, \"He would close the door of his room... and we would hear plunk, pause while he moved his fingers to the next chord, plunk, pause while he moved again, plunk.\"\n\nIn Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Neil started his professional music career in the mid-60s with a number of bands in Canada, including the Squires and later the Mynah Birds, which also included fellow future Buffalo Springfield bassist Bruce Palmer and future funk star Rick James. When the Mynah Birds broke up, Young and Palmer headed to California to meet Stephen Stills, whom he had met in Thunder Bay, and the result was Buffalo Springfield. That band split up after releasing three critically acclaimed albums, particularly achieving international fame for their tune \"For What It's Worth\".\n\nShowing his strengths as a cynical yet experimental songwriter in the group, he also sung prominently in some of the band's songs such as the biting satire of 'rock star' life \"Mr. Soul\". Neil soon started his solo career with the release of 'Neil Young' on November 12, 1968. The album did not do very well commercially, but it included several strong tracks, including \"The Loner\", said to be a portrait of Stephen Stills but also being deeply auto-biographical.\n\nOn May 14, 1969, he recruited members of Crazy Horse and made the critically acclaimed 'Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere'. This was a much more consistent album, being the first to introduce longstanding collaborators Crazy Horse and beingbuilt around the balanced interplay between the guitar playing of Young and the talented Danny Whitten.  The album also featured two lengthy classics, \"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\". The critically acclaimed solo album \"After the Gold Rush\" came out in 1971, featuring such classic songs as \"Southern Man'\", \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"Don't Let it Bring You Down\". Harvest followed in 1972 with the hit\"Heart of Gold\".\n\nDuring this time he also enjoyed considerable success as a quarter of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. \n\nNeil's subsequent work has zig-zagged across genres - dabbling in country rock on \"Old Ways\"; electronics on \"Trans\"; hooking up with the Shocking Pinks in a homage to old-time Rock 'n' Roll on \"Everybody's Rockin'\"; creating a wall of feedback on the live Arc-Weld; and cementing his status as Godfather of Grunge when collaborating with Pearl Jam on Mirror Ball.\n\nHis idiosyncratic approach to genre even led to him being sued by his record company (Geffen) in the 80s for making \"uncharacteristic\" music.\n\nYoung has also dabbled in film, most recently on the album/concert series/dvd Greendale. \n\nYoung is often known by the nickname \"Shakey.\"  According to his biographer Jimmy McDonough, the name was given by his friends after noticing very unsteady results holding a camera for home movies.\n\nYoung founded Pono Music, whose mission was to bring a digital player, download store, and streaming service devoted to hi-res music.  It was a commercial flop and was shut down in 2016.  Young has stated that the labels would not agree that \"All songs should cost the same, regardless of digital resolution.\"\n\nThe film Canadian Bacon includes the line \"Canadians are always trying to figure out a lot of ways to ruin our lives. The metric system, for the love of God! Celsius! Neil Young!\"\n\nFor recent news see: http://www.neilyoung.com/ User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Nicole Atkins": {
    "bio": "Nicole Atkins (born October 1, 1978) is an American singer-songwriter born in Neptune, NJ. She has released 4 studio albums, \"Neptune City\" (2007),  \"Mondo Amore\" (2011), \"Slow Phaser\" (2014), and  \"Goodnight Rhonda Lee\" (2017).\n\nNicole Atkins' music is a blend of the decades and an expression of the images that many of us share in our memories. Both playful and tragic and never cynical. Nicole draws upon the documents left us by heroes such as Roy Orbison, Phil Spector, Nina Simone, The Kinks, David Lynch, as much as her own experiences learning from the new heroes like Stephen Malkmus, Wilco, Lucinda Williams.\n\nShe grew up in Shark River Hills, a middle class enclave within Neptune overlooking the Shark River. Atkins has cited the river (technically a bay) as a major inspiration for her music, particularly the imagery of “the river in the rain” found in the title track on her album Neptune City. She started playing piano when she was 9 and taught herself to play guitar at 13. She eschewed more popular acts of the day for musical groups her parents listened to, such as The Ronettes and Johnny Cash. She has cited The Sundays’ Harriet Wheeler as a major early influence.\n\nShe started playing in pick-up bands and doing gigs at local coffeehouses while attending St. Rose High School in the nearby town of Belmar.\n\nAfter high school, Atkins moved to Charlotte, North Carolina to study illustration at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.She ingrained herself within the city’s independent music scene, discovering bands like Superchunk and Uncle Tupelo. She also started writing original songs and befriending other local musicians. Among other bands, she joined a supergroup in the city called Nitehawk that, at one point, had almost 30 members. She also joined the band Los Parasols, releasing an EP with them entitled The Summer of Love in 2002. That same year, Atkins moved to the neighborhood of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, New York. She began performing at open mic night at the Sidewalk Café in Manhattan’s East Village. \n\nInfluenced by the artists on Rainbow Quartz, the independent record label specializing in guitar heavy pop music and traditional songwriting for which she worked, she would move away from the louder rock music she’d played in North Carolina and toward the songcraft style of Wilco and Roy Orbison.\n\nShe returned briefly to Charlotte, living in a wood shop and playing with several bands, including a group called Virginia Reel. At this time, she started writing what she termed “a mix of Americana, 60s, and indie rock.” She also recorded Bleeding Diamonds EP during her time there.\n\nShe moved back to her parents’ house in New Jersey in 2004, working odd jobs and playing local gigs. During this time, she commuted into New York by train to play gigs and maintain a connection to the city’s underground music scene. In mid-2004, Atkins and David Muller, who had played drums with Fischerspooner and The Fiery Furnaces, started working on a demo CD entitled Party’s Over. They recorded most of the album in Atkins’ parents’ house using a Casio keyboard, a ProTools rig, and a mini recorder. Drum parts were recorded at Muller’s apartment in Manhattan, with further tracks recorded at the Dietch Projects gallery in Brooklyn.\n\nIn early 2005, keyboardist Dan Chen, whom Atkins knew from her days at The Sidewalk Café, approached Atkins about forming a new group. Chen told Atkins he knew of a drummer, Dan Mintzer, who might also be interested in playing with her. When the three sat down together for the first time, Chen and Mintzer already knew how to play the songs they’d heard on Atkins' MySpace page. Eventually David Hollinghurst, another friend from The Sidewalk Café, joined the band on guitar and Derek Layes was brought on as bassist. The band, now known as Nicole Atkins & The Sea, was given a residency at the small showcase bar, Piano's, and won the attention of music industry attorney Gillian Bar. Atkins' Party’s Over demo had stirred interest from heavy metal label Roadrunner Records, among others. \n\nShe soon found herself in the midst of a bidding war between record labels and signed with Columbia Records in January 2006. In late 2006, Atkins and the Sea traveled to Sweden to record her debut album, Neptune City, at Varispeed Studios in Kalgerup and Gula Studion in Malmö with producer Tore Johansson. The album was originally scheduled for a July 2007 release, but at the behest of Columbia co-chairman Rick Rubin, it was pushed back until October 30, 2007 to accommodate re-mastering the album. It debuted at number 20 on Billboard’s Top Heatseekers chart.\n\nIn May 2009, The Sea disbanded and Atkins started collaborating on several new tracks with drummer Christopher Donofrio, bassist Anthony Chick, and guitarist Bradley York (of \"Sikamor Rooney\"). Atkins tentatively titled this lineup \"The Black Sea\". By July 2009, Atkins had ended her professional relationship with Columbia Records.\n\nIn January 2010, Atkins and The Black Sea started recording new material at Brooklyn's Seaside Lounge studio with producer Phil Palazzolo, with whom Atkins had previously worked during sessions for A.C. Newman's second solo album, \"Get Guilty\". Several other musicians joined Atkins in the studio to record the tracks for what would become her second album, Mondo Amore, including guitarist Irina Yalkowsky and bassist Jeremy Kay. Along with drummer Ezra Oklan, Yalkowsky and Kay would form the core lineup of the The Black Sea with whom Atkins would tour in support of Mondo Amore. In June 2010, Atkins signed with New York-based independent label Razor & Tie. The label released Mondo Amore on February 8, 2011.

  "Nina Simone": {
    "bio": "Eunice Kathleen Waymon (21 February 1933 – 21 April 2003), better known by her stage name Nina Simone, was an American singer, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist widely associated with jazz music. Simone aspired to become a classical pianist while working in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, soul, folk, rhythm and blues, gospel, and pop.\n\nSimone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on 21st February 1933 in Tryon, North Carolina, USA, one of eight children. Like a number of other black singers in the U.S., she was inspired as a child by Marian Anderson, and began singing at her local church, also showing great talent as a pianist. Her public debut, a piano recital, was made at the age of ten. Her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white audience members. This incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement.\n\nSimone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon (who lived into her late nineties) was a strict Methodist minister; her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman and sometime barber who suffered bouts of ill-health. Mrs Waymon worked as a maid, and her employer, hearing of Nina's talent, provided funds for piano lessons for the little girl. Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist in Eunice's continued education.\n\nAt seventeen, Simone moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she taught piano and accompanied singers. She was able to begin studying piano at New York City's prestigious Juilliard School of Music but lack of funds meant that she was unable to fulfill her dream of becoming America's first Black classical pianist. She later had an interview to study piano at the Curtis Institute, but was rejected. Simone believed this rejection, which fueled her hatred of racism, was because she was black.\n\nSimone turned to blues and jazz after getting her start at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, taking the name Nina Simone in 1954; \"Nina\" was her boyfriend's nickname for her, and \"Simone\" was after the French actress Simone Signoret. She first came to public notice in 1959 with her wrenching rendition of George Gershwin's \"I Loves You Porgy\" (from Porgy and Bess), her only Top-Forty hit in the United States. This was soon followed by the single \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" (this was also a hit in the 1980s in the United Kingdom when used for television advertisements for Chanel No 5 perfume).\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Simone was involved in the civil rights movement and recorded a number of political songs, including \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\" (later covered by Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway), \"Backlash Blues\", \"Mississippi Goddam\" (a response to the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama killing four black children), \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\", and Kurt Weill's \"Pirate Jenny\", from The Threepenny Opera, re-cast in a southern town.\n\nIn 1961, Simone recorded a version of the traditional song \"House of the Rising Sun\", which was then covered by folk-blues artist, Dave Van Ronk, and later recorded by Bob Dylan, where it was picked up by The Animals and became their signature hit. Other songs she is famous for include \"I Put a Spell on You\" (originally by Screamin' Jay Hawkins), The Beatles' \"Here Comes the Sun\", \"Four Women\", Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released\", the Bee Gees' \"To Love Somebody\", and \"Ain't Got No (I Got Life)\". The latter, from the musical Hair, was her debut in the UK charts, reaching number two in 1968, and a remixed version of the recording by Groovefinder was a UK Top Thirty hit in 2006.\n\nBroadway musicals also supplied several hits for Simone: \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\", \"Love Me or Leave Me\", \"Feeling Good\", and \"Ne Me Quitte Pas\". Also \"You Can Have Him\" on the LP Live at Town Hall recorded when she was twenty-six years old; at the end of this operatic performance, which displays her great skill as an actress as well as a musician, she whoops with joy. This single recording encapsulates her extraordinary power, wit, flexibility, sensuality and occasional menace.\n\nIn 1987 Nina experienced a resurgence in popularity when \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\", a track from her first Bethlehem Records album (1958) became a huge hit in the UK and elsewhere. Nina's versatility as an artist was evident in all her music, which often had a folk-music simplicity.\n\nIn a single concert, she moved easily from gospel-inspired tunes to blues and jazz and, in numbers like \"For All We Know\", to numbers infused with European classical stylings, and counterpoint fugues.\n\nThroughout most of her career she was accompanied by percussionist Leopoldo Flemming and guitarist and musical director Al Shackman.\n\nIn 1971, Simone left the United States following disagreements with her agents, record labels, and the tax authorities, citing racism as the reason. She returned in 1978 and was arrested for tax evasion (she had withheld several years of income tax as a protest against the Vietnam War). She lived in various countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe, continuing to perform into her 60s. In the 1980s, she performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London. In 1995, Simone reportedly shot and wounded her neighbour's son with an air pistol after his laughing disturbed her concentration.\n\nShe had a reputation in the music industry for being volatile and sometimes difficult to deal with, a characterization with which Simone strenuously took issue.\n\nThough her onstage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her adoring audiences by recounting sometimes humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and soliciting requests. Simone's regal bearing and commanding stage presence earned her the title the \"High Priestess of Soul.\"\n\nIn 1993, she settled near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. She had been ill with cancer for several years before she died on 21st April 2003 in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet.\n\nSimone was the recipient of a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2000 for her song \"I Loves You Porgy.\" She has also received fifteen Grammy Award nominations. On Human Kindness Day 1974 in Washington, D.C., more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Simone. Simone received two honorary degrees in music and humanities, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Malcolm X College. She preferred to be called \"Dr. Nina Simone\" after these honors were bestowed upon her. Only two days before her death, Simone was awarded an honorary degree by the Curtis Institute, the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career.\nIn 2002, the city of Nijmegen (The Netherlands) named a street after her, the Nina Simonestraat. Simone lived in Nijmegen between 1988 and 1990.\nSimone was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.\nIn 2010 a statue in her honor was erected in Trade Street, Tryon, North Carolina, her place of birth.\n\n*Official site User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "O.V. Wright": {
    "bio": "Overton Vertis \"O. V.\" Wright (October 9, 1939 – November 16, 1980) was an American rhythm & blues and soul singer.\n\nBorn in Leno, Tennessee, Wright, as a youngster, began singing in the church. In 1956, while still in high school, he joined The Sunset Travelers as one of the lead singers for the gospel group. He later fronted a gospel music group, the Harmony Echoes. It was during this time that he was discovered (along with James Carr) by Roosevelt Jamison a songwriter and manager. Their first pop recording in 1964 was \"That's How Strong My Love Is,\" a ballad later covered by Otis Redding and the Rolling Stones. It was issued on Goldwax, the label Wright signed to after leaving his gospel career. It was later determined that Don Robey still had him under a recording contract, due to his gospel group having recorded for Peacock. After his contract was shifted to Don Robey’s Back Beat label, further R&B hits followed. Working with record producer Willie Mitchell, success continued on songs including \"Ace of Spades\" and \"A Nickel and a Nail\".\nWright's hits were much more popular in the deep South. His biggest hits were \"You're Gonna Make Me Cry\" (R&B #6, 1965), \"Eight Men, Four Women\" (R&B #4, 1967) \"Ace of Spades\" (R&B #11, 1970), \"A Nickel and a Nail\" (R&B #19, 1971). The remainder of his 17 hits charted higher than #20 on the R&B charts.\nHowever, Wright was imprisoned for narcotics offenses during the mid-1970s, and, despite signing for Hi Records and releasing a series of recordings, his commercial success failed to recover after his release. A continuing drug problem weakened his health and he died from a heart attack, in Mobile, Alabama at age 41.\n\nWright is among the most remembered voices of soul music, perhaps mostly for being sampled frequently in hip hop music. In 1996, his song, \"Motherless Child\" was sampled on the Ghostface Killah album Ironman on a song also called \"Motherless Child.\" It and another Wright recording, \"Let's Straighten It Out\" have been published on Shaolin Soul, a compilation of tracks that have been sampled by the Wu Tang Clan and its members. \"Let's Straighten It Out\" was sampled in a Wu-Tang Clan song called \"America\" from the charity compilation album America Is Dying Slowly. \"Ace of Spades\" was sampled by Slim Thug and the Boss Hogg Outlawz on a song named \"Recognize A Playa\".\nJohnny Rawls joined Wright's backing band in the mid-1970s, and played together with Wright until the latter's death in 1980. The band then continued billed as the O.V. Wright Band for another 13 years, and toured and performed with other musicians over this time span. These included B.B. King, Little Milton, Bobby Bland, Little Johnny Taylor, and Blues Boy Willie.\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Otis Redding": {
    "bio": "Otis Ray Redding Jr. (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s. During his lifetime, his recordings were produced by Stax Records, based in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nRedding was born in Dawson, Georgia, and at the age of 2, moved to Macon, Georgia. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first single, \"These Arms of Mine\", in 1962.\n\nStax released Redding's debut album, Pain in My Heart, two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small gigs in the American South. He later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.\n\nShortly before his death in a plane crash, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" with Steve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts. The album The Dock of the Bay was the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the Atco division of Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog.\n\nRedding received many posthumous accolades, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition to \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" \"Respect\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" are among his best-known songs. \n\nRedding has been called the \"King of Soul\", an honorific also given to Brown and Cooke. He remains one of the genre's most recognized artists. His lean and powerful style exemplified the Stax sound; he was said to be \"the heart and soul of Stax\", while artists such as Al Jackson, Dunn and Cropper helped to expand its structure. His open-throated singing, the tremolo/vibrato, the manic, electrifying stage performances and perceived honesty were particular hallmarks, along with the use of interjections (such as \"gotta, gotta, gotta\"), some of which came from Cooke. Producer Stewart thought the \"begging singing\" was stress-induced and enhanced by Redding's shyness.\n\nArtists from many genres have named Redding as a musical influence. George Harrison called \"Respect\" an inspiration for \"Drive My Car\". The Rolling Stones also mentioned Redding as a major influence. Other artists influenced by Redding include Led Zeppelin, Grateful Dead, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Doors, and virtually every soul and R&B musician from the early years, such as Al Green, Etta James, William Bell, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Conley. Janis Joplin was influenced by his singing style, according to Sam Andrew, a guitarist in her band Big Brother and the Holding Company. She stated that she learned \"to push a song instead of just sliding over it\" after hearing Redding.\n\nThe Bee Gees' Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb wrote the song \"To Love Somebody\" for him to record. He loved it, and he was going to \"cut it\", as Barry put it, on his return from his final concert. They dedicated the song to his memory.

  "Paul Thorn": {
    "bio": "Paul Thorn (born Paul Wayne Thorn on July 13, 1964, in Kenosha, Wisconsin) is an Americana singer-songwriter whose style is a mix of blues and rock music with a hint of Gospel. While utilizing narrative story-telling in his songs, Thorn's music is mostly centered around themes such as love, heartache, memories, his religious beliefs, and just having a good time.\n\nBefore his professional music career began, Thorn was briefly a professional boxer. After a few years of working in a local furniture factory and playing in local clubs, he was discovered by music professional Miles Copeland (brother of The Police drummer Stewart Copeland). This resulted in Thorn being signed to a recording contract with A&M Records and recording his first album, Hammer & Nail in 1997.\n\nThorn took an unexpected detour on the road to recording a follow-up to his most successful release, 2010's Pimps and Preachers. After writing many discs of semi-autobiographical tunes that have drawn comparisons to John Hiatt and John Prine, the critically acclaimed singer/songwriter - hailed as the \"Mark Twain of Americana\" - decided to do an album of covers. \"I wanted to take a break from myself,\" he reveals, \"do something different, and just have fun.\"\n\nThe collection, entitled What The Hell Is Goin' On? (Perpetual Obscurity / Thirty Tigers) finds Thorn putting his own gritty rock stamp on some of his favorite songs. There are some names familiar to Americana fans (Buddy Miller, Ray Wylie Hubbard), some lesser-known (Foy Vance, Wild Bill Emerson) and some surprises. The Buckingham/Nicks tune Don't Let Me Down Again originated on that duo's debut, not during the Fleetwood Mac era, while the Paul Rogers/Free song that Thorn chose to cover is an obscure one, Walk In My Shadow.\n\nThe idea for a covers album grew as Thorn encountered tunes that meant something important to him. \"I would hear them in the tour van or I'd be at a festival and see someone perform them live,\" Thorn says, \"and I'd say 'That's a great song, I wish I had written it!'\" One thing all the writers of these songs have in common, according to Thorn, is that they are true artists. \"They don't just write songs in an effort to become popular or follow trends,\" he explains. \"At the risk of sounding corny, they write with their hearts. None of these songs are cookie-cutter tunes like you hear on the radio today. They all have real depth, which is very appealing to me.\"\n\nThe set covers subjects that are familiar territory to Thorn, from the spiritual pull of Miller's Shelter Me Lord to the spirited fun in Big Al Anderson's Jukin'. Thorn, so skilled with his own character studies, plays storyteller with such lurid tales as Hubbard's Snake Farm and Emerson's Bull Mountain Bridge. Emerson (who has written for George Jones and Tammy Wynette) is someone, according to Thorn, who \"can tell a story in a song like nobody else.\"\n\nWhat The Hell Is Goin' On? also delivers songs of love and salvation. Vance's Shed A Little Light and Eli \"Paperboy\" Reed's Take My Love With You are emotionally powerful tunes. The latter particularly expresses Thorn's feelings about being on the road and missing his family back home: \"Being a touring musician is a blessing and a curse... and Eli put into words what I feel like sometimes.\"\n\nWhat The Hell's centerpiece is the powerful title track, a blistering look at life in modern times that was penned by blues-rock icon Elvin Bishop. \"We are living in a new world where people are very connected, but also at the same time are disconnected,\" Thorn states. \"I believe technology in moderation is good but too many folks are walking around wearing ear phones and some have forgotten the lost art of basic social skills.\"\n\nThe song also is significant because he has developed a friendship with Bishop over the years. \"I sometimes visit him at his house when I'm out in California and he always gives me a jar of his homemade jelly that he makes with fresh kiwis from his garden,\" Thorn recalls. \"He sang this song for me on his front porch one day and it blew me away.\" It was also a treat to have Bishop perform a guitar solo on the tune - which Thorn describes as \"wonderfully raw and dirty.\" Other special guests on the album are Delbert McClinton (another Thorn idol) and the marvelous singing McCrary Sisters.\n\nThe heavy lifting on the album, however, was done by Thorn and, as usual, his touring band (guitarist Bill Hinds, keyboard player Michael Graham, bassist Ralph Friedrichsen and drummer Jeffrey Perkins). \"The guys in this outfit are a tight unit and a well-oiled machine,\" he proclaims. \"I've had the same guys in my band for goin' on 15 years and they are incredible musicians.\" Another long-time collaborator is Billy Maddox, who steered the ship and also served as What The Hell's producer. The sense of camaraderie among Thorn, his band and Maddox contributes to the disc's loose, live performances. The lived-in quality is undoubted aided by the fact that Thorn and the band had already played these songs live and honed them into what he calls \"crowd-pleasers.\"\n\nPhoto of Paul ThornThorn has been pleasing crowds for years with his muscular brand of roots music - bluesy, rocking and thoroughly Southern, yet also speaking universal truths. The Tupelo, Mississippi native worked in a furniture factory, jumped out of airplanes, and was a professional boxer before sharing his experiences with the world as a singer-songwriter. Pimps and Preachers, which topped the Americana charts for three weeks and broke into the Billboard Top 100, perfectly exemplified the vivid scope of his songwriting and illuminated his family background. While his father is a Church of God Pentecostal Minister, his uncle (his father's brother) spent time as a pimp, and Thorn was influenced by both of these men. Mining these \"saint and sinner\" scenarios, Thorn crafted a disc that All Music Guide lauded as \"a great rock & roll album,\" while The Nation labeled it \"an incredible find.\"\n\nWhen Thorn and his band hit the road, he'll be performing both his captivating originals and these favored covers, because, as he says, \"there are so many great writers out there whose songs need to be heard.\" Thorn also might slip in a new song or two as he already has started writing more songs of his own for the next album.

Having achieved his best successes in the mid-to-late 60s and early 70s with a series of emotional soul songs, in his later years he received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Career Achievement Award and was inducted in 2005 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nPercy Sledge worked in the fields in Leighton before he worked as an orderly at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield. By the mid-1960s, Sledge was touring the Southeast with the Esquires Combo on weekends and working at the hospital. A former patient who was a friend of producer Quin Ivy introduced the two, an audition followed, and Sledge was signed to a recording contract.\n\nSledge's smooth voice was perfect for the series of soul ballads produced by Ivy and Marlin Greene, which rock critic Dave Marsh called \"emotional classics for romantics of all ages.\"\n\n\"When a Man Loves a Woman\" was the first song recorded under the contract (released in 1966), and it became not only an international hit (it reached #1 in the US) but was also the first gold record released by Atlantic Records. The magnificent soul anthem became the cornerstone of Sledge's career and was followed by \"Warm and Tender Love,\" \"Take Time to Know Her,\" and \"Cover Me.\"\n\nSledge charted with \"I'll Be Your Everything\" and \"Sunshine\" during the 1970s, and has become an international concert favorite throughout the world, especially in the Netherlands, Germany, and on the African continent.\n\nHis career enjoyed a renaissance in the 1980s when \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" re-entered the Top 10 in the UK after being used in a Levi's commercial.\n\nSledge was an inaugural Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award honoree in 1989. In 2005, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "The Persuasions are an a cappella group that began singing together in Brooklyn, New York in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe Persuasions were formed in Brooklyn in 1962, singing a cappella under corner streetlights and in subway corridors. Their style combined gospel, soul, early rock and jazz into melodic five-part harmonies. Since being discovered by Frank Zappa, The Persuasions have recorded 25 albums to date featuring the arrangements by Jimmy Hayes, Jerry Lawson, Joe Russell, Jayotis Washington and Herbert Rhoad and studio productions of music including tributes to Frank Zappa, The Beatles & The Grateful Dead.\n\nThe Persuasions made appearances on such public affairs television shows as Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant on WNEW-TV and Like it Is on WABC-TV in 1968. Frank Zappa was responsible for The Persuasions' first LP, Acappella. He heard The Persuasions singing over the phone from a New Jersey record shop known as Stan's Square Records. The store's owner, Stan Krause, was the group's manager at the time. Prior to that time, The Persuasions had recorded several a cappella tracks for Krause's record label, Catamount Records. Zappa had an appreciation for soul and street corner style singing, and after hearing the group, flew them to Los Angeles to record their first album. The Persuasions were the opening act at The Mothers concerts at Carnegie Hall, 1971. Thirty years later, Zappa fan Rip Rense supervised and encouraged the group in the creation of a Persuasions tribute CD to Zappa, Frankly A Cappella on Earthbeat Records.\n\nThe Persuasions later recorded tribute albums consisting of material by the Grateful Dead (Might as Well), the Beatles (The Persuasions sing the Beatles). The last album they made together prior to Lawson's departure was on the Chesky label titled A Cappella Dreams.\n\nHerbert \"Toubo\" Rhoad, one of the original members of The Persuasions, died in 1988 while on tour and is survived by his wife April and children Paris and Zina. In 1990, The Persuasions performed on the PBS TV special Spike Lee & Company – \"Do It A Cappella\". Sweet Joe Russell died in 2012 and is survived by his wife Arelena.\n\nIn 2007, Jerry Lawson released his first post-Persuasions a cappella CD with his new group, Jerry Lawson and Talk of The Town. In December 2010, Jerry Lawson and Talk of The Town were featured on Series 2 of NBC's The Sing-Off. Lawson was invited back on season 3 as a featured guest without Talk of the Town. He was accompanied by 16 cast members, performing the Arthur Conley hit (written by Sam Cooke) \"Sweet Soul Music\". In 2015 he released his debut as a solo artist, Jerry Lawson Just A Mortal Man, on Red Beet Records. It was featured on NPR with host Joel Rose.\n\nGroups as varied as Take 6, Rockapella, The Nylons, and Boyz II Men cite The Persuasions as major influences.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Persuasions among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nPersonnel\nFounding members\nJerry Lawson – tenor, baritone, lead singer, arranger and producer (b.

Do It A Cappella [soundtrack] (1990; Elektra)\nNed Sublette & Lawrence Weiner (with Kim Weston, Junior Mance, et al.): Monsters from the Deep (1997; Qbadisc/Excellent)\n\n\n\nThe Persuasions are the undisputed heavyweight champions of a cappella. They are, as the L.A. Weekly wrote, \"to singing what Muhammad Ali was to boxing---invincible, innovative, original, beautiful.\"\n\nThe original five Persuasions---Jerry Lawson, Jimmy Hayes, Joe Russell, Jayotis Washington, and Toubo Rhoad---fell together by chance in 1962, harmonizing on outdoor basketball courts in Brooklyn after pick-up games. They went on to release 18 albums, and to perform or record with artists including Liza Minelli, Bette Midler, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Van Morrison, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle, Little Richard, Nancy Wilson, The Neville Brothers, Country Joe McDonald, B.B. King. Their music has turned up in films from Joe and the Volcano to The Heartbreak Kid, Streets of Gold, and E.T.\n\nThroughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s, The Persuasions preached the a cappella gospel almost entirely alone, until the genre suddenly acquired mainstream popularity, partly as an outgrowth of rap and hip-hop. They were in the tradition of great gospel a cappella groups such as The Golden Gate Quartet and The Fairfield Four, but they advanced the art form into a percolating, pulsing meld of rock 'n' roll, soul, country, blues. . .In short, they \"Persuasioned\" any songs that suited them, and made them their own---from \"Papa Oom Mow Mow\" to \"Curtis Mayfield's \"Man Oh Man.\"\n\n In 1988, baritone Rhoad, whose rough-edged voice was considered the \"glue\" of the group's sound, blending the high profile voices of Lawson and Russell in particular, died in the middle of a tour from a stroke. His ashes were scattered by his fellow Persuasions in his beloved San Francisco Bay, and the group continued as a quartet for the next seven years, always introducing Rhoad faithfully at each concert. Baritone and former Drifter Bernard \"B.J.\" Jones joined in 1996, and in March, 1999, the addition of first tenor Raymond X. Sanders (The Coasters, The Paragons) made the group a sextet. Both had intermittenly toured and recorded with The Persuasions throughout the '90s. \n\nIn 2003, lead singer and founding member Lawson left  to pursue an independent career. He is currently embarked on a variety of projects, including his first A Cappella CD since leaving The Persuasions titled \"Jerry Lawson & Talk of the Town\".. (For more information, please visit http://www.jerrylawson.biz .)\n\n\nThe Persuasions are hailed by a cappella ensembles everywhere as a seminal, inimitable influence. From Rockapella to The Nylons, contemporary vocal bands speak of Persuasions albums with reverence. Critics often place Lawson’s inspired phrasing and warm baritone in the same context with Sam Cooke, Brook Benton, Otis Redding.The collective harmonies, learned on the street corner and honed over decades on the road, gave the group a sound as unmistakable as The Modern Jazz Quartet, or The Beach Boys.\n\nRock critic and author Greil Marcus once called The Persuasions’ style a \"perfect marriage of passion and intelligence,\" and Rolling Stone rated their 1977 album, Chirpin’, as one of the hundred best works of the 1970s. Mix Magazine proclaimed \"The Persuasions are four parts of one voice, one spirit.\" Cash Box correctly noted, in 1996, \"These all-vocal, instrument-free heroes paved the way for today’s platinum a cappella acts, Take 6 and Bobby McFerrin, as well as the retro-hip-hop styles of Boyz II Men and Color Me Badd.\"\n\nPerhaps, to really understand the charm of this American musical institution, it is best to quote Tom Waits:\n\n\"These guys,\" he said, \"are deep sea divers. I’m just a fisherman in a boat.\"\n\nWhy the name, \"Persuasions?\" Well, as one story goes, the group decided early on that if Christ had to persuade people to listen, and so did five guys without a band.\n\nThe original Persuasions came to Brooklyn from Florida (Lawson), North Carolina (Russell), Virginia (Hayes), and Detroit (Washington.) (Newer members Jones and Sanders are New York born-and-raised.) They all came from both church and secular musical backgrounds, and from the start, their repertoire was a mix of gospel, soul, and pop. They graduated from parties to performance by the mid-60s, a pivotal point coming when they worked for Robert F. Kennedy in Project Restoration and other efforts to aid African-Americans in the inner cities. It helped cement their resolve, and sense of mission.\n\nThe Persuasions were \"discovered\" by Frank and Gail Zappa in 1968. The group's friend (and eventual producer/manager of the '70s) David Dashev called Zappa from a New York rehearsal studio, declaring, \"You've got to hear this.\" Zappa was so taken with the tape, even over the phone, that he had Dashev bring it to California for a listen. There, after getting a thumbs-up from an enthused Gail, Frank signed the the group to his own label for Warner Brothers, Straight Records. The Persuasions debuted to the world with the half-studio, and half-live A Cappella, in the fall of 1970.\n\nSaid Zappa, to this writer, many years later:\n\n\"I could tell, even over the phone, that these guys were something special.\"\n\nFollowing their Straight album, The Persuasions signed with Capitol and recorded three of the most arresting vocal albums ever made: the Dashev-produced We Came to Play, Spread the Word, and Street Corner Symphony. They covered tunes by Bob Dylan, Kurt Weill, Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke, The Temptations, Joe South, Rogers and Hammerstein, Lennon and McCartney. The Persuasions came to be regarded as hip fare on college radio in the early 70s, and their first albums became, for a short time, FM staples. Dr. Demento, an early champion of the group, enlisted them to record a jingle for his still-running novelty radio show, still fondly remembered by listeners.\n\nStill, ‘70s rock-and-disco-dominated radio never quite figured out how to program or market The Persuasions. Record companies weren't sure how to promote them, regarding them as a curiosity; even a tax write-off. Sure, they were enormously popular on the road, but. . . they had no band, and their material was so eclectic. Were they a novelty? Folk? R&B?  Soul? Oldies? Gospel? It took Tower Records at least 20 years to stop filing their records and CDs in \"oldies,\" \"vocals,\" and \"R&B,\" and finally just give them their own category where they belonged: \"Rock and Pop.\"\n\nAsking why The Persuasions’ 1000-plus song repertory is so eclectic is perhaps like asking the same question of Frank Sinatra.\n\n\"I don’t believe in categories,\" Lawson once said. \"We love all kinds of music: Brook Benton, gospel, blues, Frank Zappa---hell, we even do ‘I Woke Up In Love This Morning,’ a song I heard on The Partridge Family TV show! It’s all music. Give it to us, and we’ll do it Persuasions-style. There are just certain songs that are Persuasions song.\"\n\nFrom Dylan’s \"The Man in Me\" to Zappa’s withering commentary, \"The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing\" and Kurt Weill’s \"Oh Heavenly Salvation\"---even The Grateful Dead’s poignant \"Black Muddy River\"---The Persuasions imbue songs with a conviction, heart, and humor that perhaps even the authors didn’t intend, or understand. Gail Zappa, upon hearing them sing \"Black Muddy River\" in concert, later remarked to this writer, incredulity in her voice, \"I was in tears over a Grateful Dead song!\" User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Pete Seeger": {
    "bio": "Pete Seeger (May 3, 1919 - January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer, political activist and author, and a key figure in the mid-20th century American folk music revival. He is particularly loved as the author (or co-author) of the songs Where Have All the Flowers Gone, If I Had a Hammer, and Turn, Turn, Turn. One of his brothers is Mike Seeger; Peggy Seeger is his half-sister. \n\nAs a member of The Weavers, Seeger had a string of hits, including a 1949 recording of Leadbelly's \"Goodnight Irene\" that topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. He was formerly a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America and was a major contributor to folk and protest music in the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nPerhaps best known today as the author or co-author of the songs Where Have All the Flowers Gone, If I Had a Hammer, and Turn, Turn, Turn, songs that have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and which are still sung all over the world. Flowers was a hit recording for The Kingston Trio (1962), Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962), and Johnny Rivers (1965). \"If I Had a Hammer\" was a hit for Peter, Paul & Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963), while The Byrds popularized \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" in the mid-1960s. \n\nEarly work\n\nSeeger dropped out of Harvard (where he studied journalism) in 1939, and he took a job in Washington, D.C. at the Archive of American Folk Song in the Library of Congress. In that capacity, he met and was influenced by many important musicians such as Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly. He met Woody at a \"Grapes of Wrath\" migrant workers concert on March 3, 1940 and the two began a musical collaboration after that.\n\nIn 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic How to Play the Five-String Banjo, a book that many banjo players credit with starting them off on the instrument. He went on to invent the Long Neck or Seeger banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 Frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo.\n\nAs a self-described \"split tenor\" (between an alto and a tenor), he was a founding member of the folk groups the Almanac Singers with Woody Guthrie and the Weavers with Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman. The Weavers had major hits in the early 1950s before being blacklisted in the McCarthy Era.\n\nOn August 18, 1955, Pete was subpoenaed to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) where he refused to name personal and political associations stating it would violate his First Amendment rights... \"I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this.\" Seeger's refusal to testify led to a March 26, 1957 indictment for contempt of Congress; for some years, he had to keep the federal government apprised of where he was going any time he left the Southern District of New York. He was convicted in a jury trial in March 1961, and sentenced to a year in jail, but in May 1962 an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.\n\nSeeger started a solo career in 1958 and is known for songs such as \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?,\" \"If I Had a Hammer\" (co-written with Lee Hays), \"Turn, Turn, Turn,\" adapted from the Book of Ecclesiastes, and \"We Shall Overcome\" (based on a spiritual and later became the unofficial anthem for the civil rights movement). Seeger became influential in the 1960s folk revival centered in Greenwich Village. He helped found Broadside Magazine and Sing Out! He was strongly associated with Moses Asch and Folkways Records. To describe the new crop of folk singers, many of whom were politically minded in their songs, he coined the phrase \"Woody's children\", alluding to his former bandmate Woody Guthrie, who had become a legendary figure. He has often sung and is associated with the song \"Joe Hill\".\n\nIn the mid-sixties, he hosted a regional folk music TV show called Rainbow Quest which featured folk musicians playing traditional folk music. Among his guests were Johnny Cash, June Carter, Mississippi John Hurt, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Roscoe Holcomb, The Stanley Brothers, Doc Watson, Tom Paxton, Judy Collins, Richard Fariña and Mimi Fariña, and many others. Thirty-eight hour-long programs were recorded at new UHF station WNJU's Newark studios in 1965 and 1966, produced by Seeger and his wife Toshi with Sholom Rubinstein.\n\nAn early advocate of Bob Dylan, Seeger was supposedly incensed over the distorted electric sound Dylan brought into the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, especially with the inability to hear the lyrics. There are many conflicting versions of exactly what ensued, some claiming that he tried to disconnect the equipment. He is often cited as one of the main opponents to Dylan at Newport 1965, but claimed in 2005:\n\n    \"There are reports of me being anti-him going electric at the '65 Newport Folk Festival, but that's wrong. I was the MC that night. He was singing 'Maggie's Farm' and you couldn't understand a word because the mic was distorting his voice. I ran to the mixing desk and said, 'Fix the sound, it's terrible!' The guy said 'No, that's how they want it.' And I did say that if I had an axe I'd cut the cable! But I wanted to hear the words. I didn't mind him going electric.\n\nLater work\n\nSeeger achieved some notoriety in 1967 and 1968 for his song \"Waist Deep in the Big Muddy\", about a captain—a \"big fool\"—who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in Louisiana during World War II. Seeger performed the song on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour after some arguments with CBS about whether the song's lyrics were objectionable. Although the song was cut from the Smothers Brothers show in September 1967, Seeger returned in January 1968 and sang the entire song. It was an allegory about the U.S. under the leadership of Lyndon Johnson which was in over its head in the Vietnam War.\n\nAnother slight against Lyndon Johnson can be heard in his singing of Len Chandler's seemingly juvenile song, \"Beans in My Ears\" from his 1966 album Dangerous Songs!? in which he accuses \"Mrs. Jay's little son Alby\" (Alby Jay is meant to sound like LBJ) of having beans in his ears, or of not listening to the people.\n\nIn 1998 a double-CD tribute album was released - \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger\". It contained contributions from Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Ani DiFranco, Billy Bragg, Eliza Carthy, Bruce Springsteen, Roger McGuinn, Judy Collins, Indigo Girls, Dick Gaughan, Martin Simpson, Odetta and others.\n\nPete Seeger continued to perform occasionally in public until his death, and for several years appeared at the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough Tennessee to tell stories, mostly children's stories such as Abiyoyo.

  "Peter Tosh": {
    "bio": "Winston Hubert McIntosh, OM (19 October  1944 – 11 September 1987), professionally known as Peter Tosh, was a Jamaican reggae musician. Along with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, he was one of the core members of the band the Wailers (1963–1976), after which he established himself as a successful solo artist and a promoter of Rastafari. He was murdered in 1987 during a home invasion.\n\nEarly music and with the Wailers\nTosh was born in Westmoreland, the westernmost parish of Jamaica. He was abandoned by his parents and \"shuffled among relatives\". When McIntosh was fifteen, his aunt died and he moved to Trenchtown in Kingston, Jamaica. He first learned guitar after watching a man in the country play a song that captivated him. He watched the man play the same song for half a day, memorizing everything his fingers were doing. He then picked up the guitar and played the song back to the man. The man then asked McIntosh who had taught him to play; McIntosh told him that he had. During the early 1960s, as an aspiring musician, Tosh went to vocal teacher Joe Higgs, who gave free music lessons to young people. Through his contact with Higgs, Tosh met Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) and Neville O'Reilly Livingston (Bunny Wailer). He then changed his name to Peter Tosh and the trio started singing together in 1962. Higgs taught the trio to harmonise and while developing their music, they would often play on the street corners of Trenchtown.\n\nIn 1964 Tosh helped organise the band the Wailing Wailers, with Junior Braithwaite, a falsetto singer, and backup singers Beverley Kelso and Cherry Smith. Initially, Tosh was the only one in the group who could play musical instruments. According to Bunny Wailer, Tosh was critical to the band because he was a self-taught guitarist and keyboardist, and thus became an inspiration for the other band members to learn to play. The Wailing Wailers had a major ska hit with their first single, \"Simmer Down\", and recorded several more successful singles before Braithwaite, Kelso and Smith left the band in late 1965. Marley spent much of 1966 in Delaware in the United States with his mother, Cedella (née Malcolm) Marley-Booker, and for a brief time was working at a nearby Chrysler factory. He returned to Jamaica in early 1967 with a renewed interest in music and a new spirituality. Tosh and Bunny were already Rastafarians when Marley returned from the US, and the three became very involved with the Rastafari faith. Soon afterwards, they renamed the musical group the Wailers. Tosh would explain later that they chose the name Wailers because to \"wail\" means to mourn or to, as he put it, \"...express one's feelings vocally\". He also claims that he was the beginning of the group, and that it was he who first taught Bob Marley the guitar. Also according to Bunny Wailer, the early Wailers learned to play instruments from Tosh.\n\nDuring the mid-1960s Tosh, along with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, were introduced to Danny Sims and Johnny Nash who signed the three artists to an exclusive recording contract on Sims' and Nash's JAD Records label as well as an exclusive publishing agreement through Sims' music publishing company, Cayman Music. Rejecting the up-tempo dance of ska, the band slowed their music to a rocksteady pace, and infused their lyrics with political and social messages inspired by their new-found faith. The Wailers composed several songs for the American-born singer Nash before teaming with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry to record some of the earliest well-known reggae songs, including \"Soul Rebel\", \"Duppy Conqueror\", and \"Small Axe\". The collaboration had given birth to reggae music and in 1970 bassist Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett and his brother, drummer Carlton Barrett, joined the group. They recorded the album The Best of The Wailers, which was produced by Leslie Kong and released in 1971.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1972, Danny Sims assigned the balance of the JAD Records recording contract with the band to Chris Blackwell and Island Records company and released their debut, Catch a Fire, in 1973, following it with Burnin' the same year. The Wailers had moved from many producers after 1970 and there were instances where producers would record rehearsal sessions that Tosh did and release them in England under the name \"Peter Touch\".\n\nIn 1973, Tosh was driving home with his girlfriend Evonne when his car was hit by another car driving on the wrong side of the road. The accident killed Evonne and severely fractured Tosh's skull. After Island Records president Chris Blackwell refused to issue his solo album in 1974, Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the Wailers, citing the unfair treatment they received from Blackwell, to whom Tosh often referred with a derogatory play on Blackwell's surname, 'Whiteworst'. Tosh had written many of the Wailers' hit songs such as \"Get Up, Stand Up\", \"400 Years\", and \"No Sympathy\". Tosh began recording and released his solo debut, Legalize It, in 1976 with CBS Records company, and Treasure Isle. The title track soon became popular among endorsers of cannabis legalization, reggae music lovers and Rastafari all over the world, and was a favourite at Tosh's concerts.\n\nThat was his last album from the Wailers, Island Records. In 2013, a book co-written by French scholar Dr Jeremie Kroubo Dagnini and American Lee Jaffe, his former associate, says Tosh was part of a smuggling operation that raised money to fund this album.\n\nSolo career\nTosh started to make his own albums with Rolling Stones Records and CBS Records Equal Rights followed in 1977, featuring his recording of a song co-written with Marley, \"Get Up, Stand Up\", and a cover of \"Stepping Razor\" that would also appear on the soundtrack to the film Rockers.\n\nTosh organised a backing band, Word, Sound and Power, who were to accompany him on tour for the next few years, and many of whom performed on his albums of this period. In 1978, the Rolling Stones record label Rolling Stones Records contracted with Tosh, on which the album Bush Doctor was released, introducing Tosh to a larger audience. The album featured Rolling Stones frontmen Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and the lead single – a cover version of The Temptations song \"Don't Look Back\" – was performed as a duet with Jagger.\n\nDuring Bob Marley's free One Love Peace Concert of 1978, Tosh lit a marijuana spliff and lectured about legalising cannabis, lambasting attending dignitaries Michael Manley and Edward Seaga for their failure to enact such legislation. Several months later he was apprehended by police as he left Skateland dance hall in Kingston and was beaten severely while in police custody.\n\nMystic Man (1979), and Wanted Dread and Alive (1981) followed, both released on Rolling Stones Records. Tosh tried to gain some mainstream success while keeping his militant views, but was only moderately successful, especially when compared to Marley's achievements.\n\nIn 1984, after the release of 1983's album Mama Africa, Tosh went into self-imposed exile, seeking the spiritual advice of traditional medicine men in Africa, and trying to free himself from recording agreements that distributed his records in South Africa. Tosh had been at odds for several years with his label, EMI, over a perceived lack of promotion for his music.\n\nTosh also participated in the international opposition to South African apartheid by appearing at anti-apartheid concerts and by conveying his opinion in various songs like \"Apartheid\" (1977, re-recorded 1987), \"Equal Rights\" (1977), \"Fight On\" (1979), and \"Not Gonna Give It Up\" (1983). In 1987, Peter Tosh seemed to be having a career revival. He was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Performance in 1987 for No Nuclear War, his last record.\n\nDeath\nOn 11 September 1987, just after Tosh had returned to his home in Jamaica, a three-man gang came to his house on motorcycles demanding money. Tosh replied that he did not have any with him but the gang did not believe him. They stayed at his residence for several hours and tortured Tosh in an attempt to extort money from him. Over the hours, as various associates of Tosh arrived to visit him, they were also taken hostage by the gunmen. The gunmen became more and more frustrated, especially the chief thug, Dennis \"Leppo\" Lobban, a man whom Tosh had previously befriended and tried to help find work after a long jail sentence. Tosh said he did not have any money in the house, after which Lobban and the fellow gunmen began opening fire in a reckless manner. Tosh was shot twice in the head and killed. Herbalist Wilton \"Doc\" Brown and disc jockey Jeff 'Free I' Dixon also died as a result of wounds sustained during the robbery. Several others in the house were wounded, including Tosh's common law wife Andrea Marlene Brown, Free I's wife Yvonne (\"Joy\"); Tosh's drummer Carlton \"Santa\" Davis, and musician Michael Robinson.\n\nAccording to Police Commissioner Herman Ricketts, Dennis \"Leppo\" Lobban surrendered and two other men were interrogated but not publicly named. Lobban went on to plead innocent during his trial, telling the court he had been drinking with friends. The trial was held in a closed court due to the involvement of illegal firearms. Lobban was ultimately found guilty by a jury of eight women and four men and sentenced to death by hanging. His sentence was commuted in 1995 and Lobban remains in jail. Another suspect was acquitted due to insufficient evidence. The other two gunmen were never identified by name.\n\nDiscography\nLegalize It (1976)\nEqual Rights (1977)\nBush Doctor (1978)\nMystic Man (1979)\nWanted Dread & Alive (1981)\nMama Africa (1983)\nNo Nuclear War (1987) User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Phil Lesh": {
    "bio": "Philip Chapman Lesh (March 15, 1940 – October 25, 2024) was an American musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he developed a unique style of playing improvised six-string bass guitar. He was their bassist throughout their 30-year career.\n\nAfter the group disbanded in 1995, Lesh continued the tradition of Grateful Dead family music with a side project, Phil Lesh and Friends, which paid homage to the Dead's music by playing their repertoire, as well as songs by members of his own group. Lesh operated a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads. From 2009 to 2014, he performed in Furthur alongside former Grateful Dead bandmate Bob Weir. He scaled back touring in 2014 but continued to perform concerts.\n\nBackground\nLesh was born in Berkeley, California, on March 15, 1940, the only child of Frank Lesh, an amateur piano player, and Barbra Chapman. His father encouraged him to take up the violin at the age of eight. At El Cerrito High School in East Bay he became a member of the school's marching band.\n\nWhile enrolled at Berkeley High School he switched to trumpet and participated in the school's music-related extracurricular activities. He studied the instrument under Bob Hansen, conductor of the symphonic Golden Gate Park Band and became interested in avant-garde classical music and free jazz. By his mid-teens, inspired by Beethoven and Charles Ives, he had decided that he wanted to be a composer.\n\nLesh enrolled at the College of San Mateo, where he wrote arrangements for the community college's big band and played trumpet. After transferring with sophomore standing to the University of California, Berkeley in 1961, he befriended future Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten. At Constanten's suggestion, he studied under the Italian modernist Luciano Berio in a graduate-level course at Mills College in the spring of 1962, where their classmates included Steve Reich and Stanford University cross-registrant John Chowning.\n\nWhile volunteering for radio station KPFA as a recording engineer, Lesh met bluegrass banjo player Jerry Garcia and invited him to perform on the station's Midnight Special show, and despite their different musical interests they became friends. Lesh briefly worked in the Post Office Department, where he drove a service truck. In spring 1965 he saw Garcia's new band, the Warlocks, in concert, and was impressed. A few weeks later Garcia invited him to become the group's bassist. This was unexpected, as Lesh had never played bass guitar. According to Lesh, the first song he rehearsed with the band was \"I Know You Rider\". He joined them for their third or fourth gig (memories vary) and stayed until the end.\n\nThe group changed its name to the Grateful Dead and began playing at Ken Kesey's Acid Tests parties (LSD then being legal in California). In late 1966 Lesh moved with the group to San Francisco, where they were signed to a recording deal with Warner Brothers, and found himself playing at venues such as the Filmore and the Avalon. As Lesh had never before played bass he learned \"on the job\", which meant he had no preconceived ideas about the instrument's traditional role in the rhythm section and was free to develop his own style. In his autobiography, he credited Jack Casady (the bassist in San Francisco band Jefferson Airplane) as an influence on the direction in which his instincts were taking him. He said that his playing style was influenced more by Bach's counterpoint than by contemporaneous rock and soul bass players. He also cited Jack Bruce of Cream as an influence.\n\nMusic\nLesh became an innovator in the new role that the electric bass was developing during the mid-1960s. Contemporary bass players such as Casady, Bruce, James Jamerson, and Paul McCartney had adopted a more melodic, contrapuntal approach to the instrument. Before this, bass players in rock had generally played a conventional timekeeping role within the beat of the song, within (or underpinning) the song's harmonic or chord structure. While not abandoning these elements, Lesh went on his own improvised excursions during a song or instrumental, and in the group's long improvised jams in their live performances Lesh's six-string bass complemented Garcia's guitar solos with cascades of notes and unusual time signatures. This became a characteristic part of the so-called San Francisco Sound in the new rock music.\n\nEarly on, Lesh grasped the sonic possibilities presented by recording in the studio, and his style of playing often led to complaints by the band's record label. Joe Smith of Warner Bros. wrote a letter about cost overruns that had accumulated during studio sessions for the band's second album, Anthem of the Sun (1968). According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Smith singled him out as \"the catalyst for chaos within the band\", writing: \"It's apparent that nobody in your organization has enough influence over Phil Lesh to evoke anything resembling normal behavior.\" Lesh was not a prolific composer or singer with the Grateful Dead, though he did occasionally make contributions such as the opening track on American Beauty, \"Box of Rain\". He co-wrote several of the band's best-known compositions, including \"St Stephen\", \"The Eleven\" and \"Dark Star\". His high tenor voice contributed to the Grateful Dead's three-part harmony sections in their group vocals in the early days of the band, until he largely relinquished singing high parts to Donna Godchaux (and subsequently Brent Mydland and Vince Welnick) in 1974 because of vocal cord damage from improper singing technique. In the early 80s, he resumed singing lead vocals on songs closer to his natural vocal range.\n\nLesh introduced his bandmates to the aural explorations of the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. All of the band's shows were recorded by Deadhead tapers, and it became possible to listen to any given performance from 1972 or 1974 and hear the Grateful Dead interpreting the musical innovations that Lesh stimulated through Coltrane's influence. Throughout the Dead's career, his interest in jazz avant-garde music remained a crucial influence on the group. He later introduced the band to composer Charles Ives, which created their ability to go spontaneously from a discordant jam into a blues or country song. In the 30 years between 1965 and 1995 Lesh played almost 2,500 concerts with the Grateful Dead, many of them lasting for up to six hours.\n\nLesh collaborated with Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley, the Dead's onetime sound engineer (and former source of LSD) in designing the Wall of Sound, an enormous sound reinforcement system they used for forty-odd shows in the 1974 tour. After two years of problem-solving and planning, the forty-foot high Wall of Sound was first used publicly at the Cow Palace in San Francisco on March 23, 1974. With nine independent channels, the powerful system contained 604 speakers driven by 26,400 watts of power. Lesh compared playing through the system to \"piloting a flying saucer. Or riding your own sound wave\". According to Lesh, Owsley persuaded the Dead to record every one of their shows, emphasizing the necessity of listening to the tapes.\n\nIn 1994, Lesh was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.\n\nPost-Grateful Dead\nAfter the Grateful Dead disbanded, Lesh continued to play the band's music in concert with its offshoots The Other Ones and The Dead and to promote San Francisco hippy philosophy, as well as performing with his own band, Phil Lesh and Friends. In 1999 and 2000, he co-headlined two tours with Bob Dylan.\n\nLesh published his autobiography, Searching for the Sound: My Life with the Grateful Dead in 2005. In 2009, he went on tour with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead. After the 2009 summer tour, Lesh formed a new band with Bob Weir named Furthur which debuted in September 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Lesh founded a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads, in San Rafael, California. The venue officially opened on March 8, 2012, with a first of a run of twelve concerts by Phil Lesh and Friends. When not on tour, Lesh's sons, Grahame and Brian, served as the house band at Terrapin Crossroads. In addition to songs from the Dead catalog, Lesh played material by Mumford & Sons, Zac Brown Band and other contemporary acts with his sons. Terrapin Crossroads closed in November 2021 when their lease on the property expired.\n\nLesh began performing again with Phil Lesh and Friends in 2012. Furthur disbanded in early 2014 and, at age 74, Lesh ceased touring full time. Thereafter he performed regularly at Terrapin Crossroads with various Phil Lesh and Friends lineups as well as with the Terrapin Family Band. In the early 2010s he performed select shows at venues throughout the United States, notably the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, as well as at festivals. He took part in the 2015 Fare Thee Well concerts, and a short North American tour with Bob Weir in the spring of 2018. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 11th greatest bass player. In March 2023, he celebrated his 83rd birthday and hundredth show at the Capitol Theatre.\n\nPersonal life, health and death\nLesh married Jill Johnstone, a waitress from the cafe next door to the Grateful Dead's office in San Francisco. They had two sons, Grahame and Brian, both of whom became musicians and played with their father in the Terrapin Family Band. They frequently played together, both publicly and in private. They performed in an annual benefit concert group known as Philharmonia, dating from 1997, including on December 18, 2011 at a Christmas gig which included Bob Weir and Jackie Greene at the Tenderloin Middle School cafeteria attended by 250 people.\n\nLesh and his wife administered their charitable organization, the Unbroken Chain Foundation.\n\nLesh had a lifelong interest in the occult and was a member of the Research Into Lost Knowledge organisation.\n\nIn 1998, Lesh underwent a liver transplant as a result of a chronic hepatitis C infection. He became an outspoken advocate for organ donation on live recordings of his performances.\n\nOn October 26, 2006, Lesh stated on his official website that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, the disease that killed his father, and would be undergoing an operation in December 2006. On December 7, 2006, he reported that he had undergone prostate surgery and the cancer had been removed. In October 2015, Lesh announced that he had had bladder cancer surgery. He stated that his prognosis was good and that he expected to make a full recovery.\n\nIn August 2019, Lesh announced that he was to undergo back surgery and he and his band canceled engagements at the Outlaw Music Festival, Telluride Blues & Brews Festival, and Dirt Farmers Festival. He was expected to make a full recovery.\n\nLesh died on October 25, 2024, at the age of 84. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Prince": {
    "bio": "Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016), more commonly known mononymously as Prince, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop.\n\nBorn and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career. In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar (known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist.\n\nAfter signing with Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. He also released songs under multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made popular after being covered by other musicians, most notably \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor and \"Manic Monday\" by the Bangles. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Released posthumously, his demo albums Piano and a Microphone 1983 (2018) and Originals (2019) both received critical acclaim.\n\nPrince sold over 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)\n\nStudio albums\nFor You (1978)\nPrince (1979)\nDirty Mind (1980)\nControversy (1981)\n1999 (1982)\nPurple Rain (1984)\nAround the World in a Day (1985)\nParade (1986)\nSign o' the Times (1987)\nLovesexy (1988)\nBatman (1989)\nGraffiti Bridge (1990)\nDiamonds and Pearls (1991)\nLove Symbol (1992)\nCome (1994)\nThe Black Album (1994)\nThe Gold Experience (1995)\nChaos and Disorder (1996)\nEmancipation (1996)\nCrystal Ball (1998)\nThe Truth (1998)\nThe Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale (1999)\nRave Un2 the Joy Fantastic (1999)\nThe Rainbow Children (2001)\nOne Nite Alone...

  "Ravi Shankar": {
    "bio": "Ravi Shankar (7 April 1920 – 11 December 2012), often referred to by the title Pandit, was a multiple Grammy Award-winning Indian musician best known for his virtuosity on the sitar. Shankar was awarded the three highest national civil honours of India: the Padma Bhushan, in 1967, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1981, and the Bharat Ratna, in 1999. He has received honours from the UNESCO International Music Council, three Grammy Awards, a Magsaysay award, a Légion d'honneur and was nominated for an Academy Award. He was also a posthumous recipient of the lifetime-achievement Grammy in 2012. Grammy award-winning singer Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar, also a Grammy-nominated sitarist, are among his three children.\n\nBorn on 7th April 1920 in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India into an orthodox, well-off Brahmin family, Rabindra Shankar Chowdery's father, ShyÆm Shankar, was employed as a diwan (minister) by the Maharajah of Jhalawar. By the age of 13, Ravi Shankar was going along on every tour of his brother Uday Shankar's Compagnie de Danse et Musique Hindoue (Company of Hindu Dance and Music). At the All-Bengali Music Conference in December 1934, he met the multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan. Precisely when Allauddin Khan was born is uncertain. People hazard dates in the 1860s around 1862, but in later years he himself gave his age haphazardly. He would transform many musicians' lives, but he had an incalculable effect on Ali Akbar (his son), Annapurna Devi (his daughter), and Shankar himself. Allauddin Khan joined Uday's troupe as its principal soloist around 1935-1936.\n\nIn 1938, Shankar gave up a potential career as a dancer and went to study with Allauddin Khan in Maihar. In 1939, he began giving public recitals and came out of training at the end of 1944. Until 1948, he based himself in Bombay and gave programs all over India. He toured and wrote for films and ballet. Around this time he began his recording career with a small session for HMV (India). Work for All India Radio followed; as music director from February 1949 to January 1956 in New Delhi. Concurrently, his international star was on the rise. In 1954, he performed in the Soviet Union. In 1956, he played his debut solo concerts in Western Europe and the U.S. Within a decade he would be the most famous Indian musician on the planet. Within two decades he would become probably the most famous Indian alive. His English-language autobiography, My Music, My Life (1969), is still one of the best general introductions to Hindustani music.\n\nShankar is not one-dimensional. Apart from pursuing a career as a classical performer, he has also experimented outside this field. For this reason he has attracted criticism from purists. Some of this, especially during the Beatles era, undoubtedly had an element of jealousy to it; some was certainly warranted, because Shankar did take many chances. In fact, that was one of the things that kept his music exciting. To use a cricketing image - baseball would be wholly inappropriate - Shankar's batting average has remained high throughout a long and illustrious career. \n\nHe is the father of both Grammy award winning singer Norah Jones, and Anoushka Shankar, also a noted sitarist.\n\nOn 6 December 2012, Shankar was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, San Diego, California after complaining of breathing difficulties. He died on 11 December 2012 at around 16:30 PST, at a hospital near his home in Encinitas, California. The Ravi Shankar Foundation issued a statement that read Shankar had suffered from upper-respiratory and heart issues over the past year and underwent heart-valve replacement surgery on 6 December 2012.

  "Ray Charles": {
    "bio": "Ray Charles (Ray Charles Robinson,  Albany, Georgia, September 23, 1930 - Beverly Hills, California, June 10, 2004), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, arranger, and band leader. \n\nAs a rock and roll, rhythm & blues, soul, blues, jazz, country and pop musician he helped to shape the sound of rhythm & blues.\n\nHe brought a soulful sound to everything from country music (\"I Can't Stop Loving You\") to rock and roll (\"Mess Around\"), to pop standards to a now-iconic rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\" Frank Sinatra called him \"the only genius in the business.\"\n\nRay Charles was born in Albany, Georgia on September 23, 1930. He was the son of Aretha Williams, a share cropper, and Bailey Robinson, a railroad repair man, mechanic and handyman. The two were never married. The family moved to Greenville, Florida, when Ray was an infant. Bailey had three more families, leaving Aretha to raise the family on her own.\n\nRay Charles was not born blind. He started to lose his sight somewhere at the age of five. He was rendered totally blind by the age of seven. Charles never knew exactly why he lost his sight, though there are sources that suggest his blindness was due to glaucoma, and some other sources suggest that Ray began to lose his sight from an infection caused by soapy water to his eyes which was left untreated. He attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida from 1937-1945 where he developed his musical gift that he is known and remembered for today. His father died when he was ten, followed by his mother five years later.\n\nIn school, he was taught only classical music, but he wanted to play what he heard on the radio, jazz and blues. After his mother died, Charles did not return to school. He lived in Jacksonville with a couple who were friends of his mother. For over a year, he played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla, earning $4 a night. Charles moved to Orlando, then Tampa, where he played \"with a hillbilly band called The Florida Playboys.\" This is where Charles began his reputation of always wearing sunglasses that were made by designer Billy Stickles.\n\nCharles had always played for other people, but he wanted a band that was his own. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, but Chicago and New York City were too big. He moved to Seattle in 1947 and soon started recording, first for the label Swing Time Records, achieving his first hit with the 1949 \"Confession Blues\". The song soared to #2 on the R&B charts. He followed his first recording with his only other hit with Swingtime, \"Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand\" in 1951. It hit #5 on the R&B charts. He then signed with Ahmet Ertegün at Atlantic Records a year later. When he entered show business, his name was shortened to Ray Charles to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.\n\nBreakthrough period with Atlantic Records\nAlmost immediately after signing with Atlantic, Charles scored his first hit singles with the label with \"It Should Have Been Me\" and the Ertegün-composed \"Mess Around\", both making the charts in 1953. But it was Charles' \"I Got A Woman\" (composed with band mate Renald Richard) that brought the musician to national prominence.\n\nThe song reached the top of Billboard's R&B singles chart in 1955 and from there until 1959, Charles would have a series of R&B chart-toppers including \"This Little Girl of Mine\", \"Lonely Avenue\", \"Mary Ann\", \"Drown in My Own Tears\" and \"The Night Time (Is the Right Time)\", which were compiled on his Atlantic releases Hallelujah, I Love Her So, Yes Indeed!, and The Genius Sings the Blues. Charles was often cited for using his voice like a saxophone, most notably by the prominent critic Victor Bollo. During this time of transition, he recruited a young girl group from Philadelphia named The Cookies as his background singing group, recording with them in New York and changing their name to the Raelettes in the process.\n\nCrossover success\nIn 1959, Charles crossed over to top 40 radio with the release of his impromptu blues number, \"What'd I Say\", which was initially conceived while Charles was in concert. The song would reach number 1 on the R&B list and would become Charles' first top ten single on the pop charts, peaking at number 6. Charles would also record The Genius of Ray Charles, before leaving Atlantic for a more lucrative deal with ABC Records in 1959.\n\nHit songs such as \"Georgia On My Mind\" (US #1), \"Hit the Road Jack\" (US #1) and \"Unchain My Heart\" (US #9) helped him transition to pop success and his landmark 1962 album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its sequel Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2, helped to bring country into the mainstream of music. He also had major pop hits in 1963 with \"Busted\" (US #4) and \"Take These Chains From My Heart\" (US #8), and also scoring a Top 20 hit four years later, in 1967, with \"Here We Go Again\" (US #15) (which would later be duetted with Norah Jones in 2004).\n\nLater years\nIn 1965, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin, a drug to which he had been addicted for nearly 20 years. It was his third arrest for the offence, but he avoided jail time after kicking the habit in a clinic in Los Angeles. He spent a year on parole in 1966, when his single \"Crying Time\" reached #6 on the charts.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Charles' releases were hit-or-miss, with some big hits and critically acclaimed work. His version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was proclaimed the state song of Georgia on April 24, 1979, with Charles performing it on the floor of the state legislature. He also had success with his unique version of \"America the Beautiful.\"\n\nIn November 1977 Charles appeared as the host of NBC's Saturday Night Live. In the 1980s a number of other events increased Charles' recognition among young audiences. He made a cameo appearance in the popular 1980 film The Blues Brothers. In 1985, \"The Right Time\" was featured in the episode \"Happy Anniversary\" of The Cosby Show on NBC. The next year in 1986, he sang America The Beautiful at Wrestlemania 2. In a Pepsi Cola commercial of the early 1990s, Charles popularized the catchphrase \"You Got the Right One, Baby!\" plus he helped in the song \"We Are the World\" a touching song for USA for Africa.\n\nDespite his support of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s and his support for the American Civil Rights Movement, Charles courted controversy when he toured South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott of the country because of its apartheid policy.\n\nCharles recorded a cover version of the Japanese band Southern All Stars' song \"Itoshi no Ellie\" as \"Ellie My Love\" for a Suntory TV advertisement, reaching #3 on Japan's Oricon chart. Eventually, it sold more than 400,000 copies, and became that year's best-selling single performed by a Western artist for the Japanese music market.\n\nBesides winning 17 Grammy Awards in his career (include five posthumous ones), Charles was also honored in many other ways. In 1979, he was one of the first honorees of the Georgia State Music Hall of Fame being recognized for being a musician born in the state. Ray's version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was made into the official state song for Georgia. In 1981, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was one of the first inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural ceremony in 1986. He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1991, he was inducted to the Rhythm & Blues Foundation. In 1998 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize together with Ravi Shankar in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2004 he was inducted to the Jazz Hall of Fame, and inducted to the National Black Sports & Entertainment Hall of Fame. Also in 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nThe Grammy Awards of 2005 were dedicated to Charles.\n\nOn December 7, 2007, Ray Charles Plaza was opened in Albany, Georgia, with a revolving, lighted bronze sculpture of Charles seated at a piano.\n\nOn December 26, 2007, Ray Charles was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.\n\nRay Charles Post Office Building\nIn 2005, the U.S. postal facility located at 4960 W. Washington Blvd., in Los Angeles, California, was designated  the Ray Charles Post Office Building. \nOn August 24, 2005, the United States Congress honored Charles by dedicating and renaming the former West Adams Station post office in Los Angeles the \"Ray Charles Station\".\n\nCharles has also appeared at two Presidential inaugurations in his lifetime. In 1985, he performed for Ronald Reagan's second inauguration, and in 1993 performed for Bill Clinton's first inauguration.\n\nIn the late '80s and early '90s, Charles made appearances on The Super Dave Osbourne Show, where he performed and appeared in a few vignettes where he was somehow driving a car, often as Super Dave's chauffeur. At the height of his newfound fame in the early nineties, Charles did guest vocals for quite a few projects. He also appeared (with Chaka Khan) on long time friend Quincy Jones' hit \"I'll Be Good to You\" in 1990, from Jones' album Back on the Block.\n\nFollowing Jim Henson's death in 1990, Ray Charles appeared in the one-hour CBS tribute, The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson. He gave a short speech about the deceased, stating that Henson \"took a simple song and a piece of felt and turned it into a moment of great power\". Charles was referring to the song \"It's Not Easy Being Green\", which Charles later performed with the rest of the Muppet cast in a tribute to Henson's legacy.\n\nDuring the sixth season of Designing Women, Ray Charles vocally performed \"Georgia On My Mind\", rather than the song being rendered by other musicians without lyrics as in the previous five seasons\n\nDuring his life he received eight honorary doctorates, the last from Dillard University in New Orleans in 2003. Later that same year, he performed his 10,000th career concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nCharles finalized \"Genius Loves Company\" a duets album in 2004, which posthumously became the best selling album of his career. Norah Jones, B.B. King, Willie Nelson, Michael McDonald, Bonnie Raitt, Gladys Knight, Johnny Mathis and James Taylor are just a few of the notable artists involved with the project.\n\nCharles was awarded the prestigious \"President's Merit Award\" from the Grammy(r) organization and was named a City of Los Angeles \"Cultural Treasure\" by LA Mayor James Hahn during \"African American Heritage Month\" in a ceremony that he attended. He also received the NAACP Image Awards' \"Hall of Fame Award.\"\n\nCharles died in July 2004 in California. Three months later, his biopic \"Ray\" opened in theaters. The performance of Jamie Foxx as Ray gave him an Oscar for best lead performance in a feature film.\n\nRecently, a series of slot machines were designed in Charles' name for the visually handicapped and the legendary performer was also named a \"living legend\" by the Library of Congress.\n\nCharles once told an interviewer from USA Today, \"Music to me is just like breathing. I have to have it. It's part of me.\" User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Richie Havens": {
    "bio": "Richard P. \"Richie\" Havens (born January 21, 1941; died April 22, 2013) was an American folk singer and guitarist. He is best remembered for his intense, rhythmic guitar style (often in open tunings), soulful covers of pop and folk songs, and his opening performance at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.\n\nBorn in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Havens moved to Greenwich Village in 1961 in time to get in on the folk boom then taking place. Havens had a distinctive style as a folksinger, appearing in such clubs as the Cafe Wha? His guitar set to an open tuning, he would strum while barring chords with his thumb, using it essentially as percussion while singing rhythmically in a gruff voice for a mesmerizing effect. Havens was signed to Douglas Records in 1965 and recorded two albums that gained him a local following. In 1967, the Verve division of MGM Records formed a folk section (Verve Forecast) and signed Havens and other folk-based performers. The result was Havens's third album, Mixed Bag. It wasn't until 1968 and the Something Else Again album, however, that Havens began to hit the charts -- actually, Havens's fourth, third, and second albums charted that year, in that order. In 1969 came the double album Richard P. Havens 1983. Havens' career benefited enormously from his appearance at the Woodstock festival in 1969 and his subsequent featured role in the movie and album made from the concert in 1970. His first album after that exposure, Alarm Clock, made the Top 30 and produced a Top 20 single in \"Here Comes the Sun.\" These recordings were Havens's commercial high-water mark, but by this time he had become an international touring success. By the end of the '70s, he had abandoned recording and turned entirely to live work.\n\nHavens came back to records with a flurry of releases in 1987: a new album, Simple Things; an album of Bob Dylan and Beatles covers; and a compilation. In 1991, Havens signed his first major-label deal in 15 years when he moved to Sony Music and released Now.\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Havens died of a heart attack at home in Jersey City, New Jersey.

  "Richie Valens": {
    "bio": "Ritchie Valens (born Richard Steven Valenzuela; on 13 May 1941 in Pacoima, California, USA  – February 3, 1959) was a Mexican American singer, songwriter and guitarist.\n\nA Rock and Roll pioneer and a forefather of the Chicano rock movement, Valens' recording career lasted only eight months. During this time, however, he scored several hits, most notably \"La Bamba\", which was originally a Mexican folk song that Valens transformed with a rock rhythm and beat that became a hit in 1958, making Valens a pioneer of the Spanish-speaking rock and roll movement.\n\nValens died in a plane crash outside Clear Lake, Iowa while on the Winter Dance Party tour. Also killed in the crash were the pilot of the plane and rock and roll stars Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper. The song American Pie, by Don McLean is a tribute to the three musicians who died, and a reflection of the changes in music since their deaths. In the song he calls the day of their death \"the day the music died,\" a phrase that came from newspaper headlines that announced the tragedy on February 3, 1959\n \nBrought up hearing traditional Mexican mariachi music, as well as flamenco guitar, R&B and jump blues, by the age of 5 he expressed an interest in making music of his own. He was encouraged by his father to take up guitar and trumpet, and it is also known that he later taught himself the drums. One day, a neighbour came across Ritchie trying to play a guitar that had only two strings. He re-strung the instrument, and taught Ritchie the fingerings of some chords. While Ritchie was left-handed, he was so eager to learn the guitar that he mastered the traditionally right-handed version of the instrument. By the time he was attending Pacoima Jr. High School, his proficiency on the guitar was such that he brought the instrument to school and would sing and play songs to his friends on the bleachers.\n\nWhen he was sixteen years old, he was invited to join a local band named The Silhouettes as guitarist. Later on, the main vocalist left the group and Ritchie assumed this position as well. In addition to the performances with The Silhouettes, he would play solo at parties and other social gatherings.\n\nA completely self-taught musician, Valenzuela was an accomplished singer and guitarist. At his appearances he often improvised new lyrics and added new riffs to popular songs while he was playing. This is an aspect of his music that is, sadly, not heard in his commercial studio recordings. Due to his high-energy performances, Valenzuela earned the nickname \"The Little Richard of the Valley\".\n\nIn 2002, he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. \"La Bamba\" was named one of The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame's Top 500 Songs Of All Time. In 2004, \"La Bamba\" was named #345 on Rolling Stone's Top 500 Songs Of All Time. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Rosanne Cash": {
    "bio": "Rosanne Cash (born May 24, 1955 in Memphis, Tennesee) is an American singer and songwriter. She is oldest daughter of Johnny Cash and his first wife, Vivian Liberto, born shortly before the release of her father's first single. She is also the stepdaughter of June Carter Cash and the stepsister of country singer Carlene Carter.\n\nCash released her first single in 1979, a duet with Bobby Bare called \"We Don't Need No Memories Hangin' 'Round\". Two years later, she had her first country No. 1 (and the biggest commercial hit of her career), \"Seven Year Ache\". Although Cash was a prominent country star throughout the '80s, alongside fellow decade-defining artists Emmylou Harris, Juice Newton, and Dolly Parton, her music was anything but traditional: She topped the charts with songs written not only by herself, but by her father (\"Tennessee Flat Top Box\"), John Hiatt (\"The Way We Make a Broken Heart\"), Tom Petty (\"Never Be You\") and the Beatles (\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\"), \"I Don't Know Why You Don't Want Me\", which won her a Grammy in 1985, and \"It's Such a Small World\", a 1987 duet with Rodney Crowell on his album Diamonds & Dirt, provided further hits. A sampling of these songs and more are included on the compilation Hits 1979-1989. In 1979, she married Rodney Crowell, who was to produce most of her hit records. Their stormy marriage lasted until 1992; its break-up is chronicled in Cash's Interiors and in Crowell's album Life Is Messy. Cash later married John Leventhal, who produced her albums The Wheel, 10 Song Demo, Rules of Travel, and Black Cadillac.\n\nTo date, Cash has had more than twenty top 40 country singles, including eleven chart-toppers, but none since 1990, and she has left Nashville in both spirit and body to pursue her artistic vision. Although she had recorded all of her hits for Columbia Records' Nashville division, she released 10 Song Demo for the pop division of Capitol. Cash resurfaced in 2003 with Rules of Travel. The album features guest appearances by Sheryl Crow and Steve Earle, as well as a tune penned by Joe Henry and the Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan. Cash's latest album, entitled Black Cadillac, was released by Capitol Records in January 2006 to critical acclaim. Many of the songs were written by Cash and address the losses (within a 24-month span) of her step-mother, her father, her step-sister (Rosey Nix Adams) and then finally her mother on Cash's fiftieth birthday.

  "Ruth Brown": {
    "bio": "Ruth Brown (1928–2006) was a U.S. rhythm and blues singer and actress, noted for bringing a popular music style to rhythm and blues in a series of hit songs for fledgling Atlantic Records in the 1950s, such as \"So Long\", \"Teardrops from My Eyes\", and \"(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean\".\n\nBorn Ruth Alston Weston on 30th January 1928 in Portsmouth, Virginia, she attended I. C. Norcom High School, a historically black high school. Brown's father was a dockhand who directed the local church choir, but the young Ruth showed more of an interest in singing at USO shows and nightclubs. She was inspired by Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington. In 1945, Brown ran away from her home in Portsmouth along with a trumpeter, Jimmy Brown, whom she soon married, to sing in bars and clubs. She then spent a month with Lucky Millinder's orchestra, but was fired after she brought drinks to the band for free, and was left stranded in Washington, D.C.\n\nBlanche Calloway, Cab Calloway's sister, also a bandleader, arranged a gig for Brown at a Washington nightclub called Crystal Caverns and soon became her manager. Willis Conover, a Voice of America disc jockey, caught her act and recommended her to Atlantic Records bosses, Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Brown was unable to audition as planned though, because of a serious car accident that resulted in a nine-month hospital stay. In 1948, however, Ertegün and Abramson drove to Washington from New York City to hear her sing in the club. Although her repertoire was mostly popular ballads, Ertegün convinced her to switch to rhythm and blues. His productions for her, however, retained her pop style, with clean, fresh arrangements and the singing spot on the beat with little of the usual blues singer's embroidery.\n\nIn her first audition, in 1949, she sang \"So Long\", which became a hit. This was followed by \"Teardrops from My Eyes\" in 1950; written by Rudy Toombs, it was the first upbeat major hit for Ruth Brown, establishing her as an important figure in R&B. Recorded for Atlantic Records in New York City in September 1950, and released in October, it was on Billboard's List of number-one R&B hits (United States) for eleven weeks. The huge hit earned her the nickname \"Miss Rhythm\", and within a few months Ruth Brown became the acknowledged queen of R&B.\n\nShe followed up this hit with \"I'll Wait for You\" (1951), \"I Know\" (1951), \"5-10-15 Hours\" (1953), \"(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean\" (1953), \"Oh What a Dream\" (1954), \"Mambo Baby\" (1954), and \"Don't Deceive Me\" (1960). She also became known as \"Little Miss Rhythm\" and \"the girl with the teardrop in her voice\". In all, she was on the R&B charts for 149 weeks from 1949 to 1955, with sixteen top-ten blues records including five number ones, and became Atlantic's most popular artist, earning Atlantic records the proper name of \"The House that Ruth Built\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, Brown faded from public view to become a housewife and mother, and only returned to music in 1975 at the urging of Redd Foxx, followed by a series of comic acting gigs, including roles in the sitcom Hello, Larry and the John Waters film Hairspray as local DJ Motormouth Maybelle, as well as Broadway appearances in Amen Corner and Black and Blue, which earned her a Tony Award for her performance and a Grammy award for her album Blues on Broadway, featuring hits from the show.\n\nBrown's fight for musicians' rights and royalties in 1987 led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. She was inducted as a Pioneer Award recipient in its first year, 1989. In 1993, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as \"The Queen Mother of the Blues\".\n\nShe has become an iconic symbol to many black women for later generations, where she is also a favourite artist and inspiration for later blues artists such as Bonnie Raitt. Brown recorded and sang along with fellow rhythm and blues performer Charles Brown, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and toured with Raitt on Raitt's tour in the late 1990s, \"Road Tested\". Her 1995 autobiography, Miss Rhythm, won the Gleason Award for music journalism.\n\nBrown died in a Las Vegas-area hospital on 17th November  2006, from complications following a heart attack and stroke she suffered after surgery in October 2006. A memorial concert for her was held on 22nd January 2007 at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, New York.\n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Sam & Dave": {
    "bio": "Sam & Dave was an American soul and rhythm and blues (R&B) duo remembered for their gospel-infused performances.  Considered one of the greatest live acts of the 1960s, The tenor (higher) voice was Sam Moore (born Samuel David Hicks in Miami, Florida, on 12 October 1935; died in Coral Gables, Florida, on January 2025), and the baritone/tenor (lower) voice was David Prater (born in Ocilla, Georgia, on 9 May 1937;  died in Sycamore, Georgia, on 9 April 1988).  Performing together from 1961 through 1981, during 1965–68 they had consistent R&B chart success in the USA, including ten consecutive top 20 singles and three consecutive top 10 albums. \n\nSam & Dave are members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and are Grammy Award and multiple gold record award winning artists. According to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Sam & Dave were the most successful soul duo, and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their call-and-response records. Recorded primarily at Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1965 through 1968, these included \"Soul Man\", \"Hold On, I'm Comin\", \"I Thank You\", \"When Something is Wrong with My Baby\", \"Wrap It Up\", and many other Southern Soul classics. Other than Aretha Franklin, no soul act during Sam & Dave's Stax years (1965-1968) had more consistent R&B chart success, including 10 consecutive top 20 singles and 3 consecutive top 10 LPs. Their crossover charts appeal (13 straight appearances and 2 top 10 singles) helped to pave the way for the acceptance of soul music by white pop audiences, and their song \"Soul Man\" was one of the first songs by a black group to top the pop charts using the word \"soul\", helping define the genre \"Soul Music\". \"Soul Man\" was a number one Pop Hit (Cashbox: November 11, 1967) and has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Rolling Stone magazine, and RIAA Songs of the Century. \"Soul Man\" was featured as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film and also a 1997–1998 television series, and Soul Men was a 2008 feature film. \n\nNicknamed \"Double Dynamite\", \"The Sultans of Sweat\", and \"The Dynamic Duo\" for their sweaty, gritty, gospel-infused performances, Sam & Dave were one of the greatest live acts of the 1960s. They were an influence on many future musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Al Green, Tom Petty, Phil Collins, Michael Jackson, Elvis Costello, Teddy Pendergrass, Billy Joel and Stevie Winwood. The Blues Brothers, who helped create a resurgence of popularity for soul, R&B, and blues in the 1980s, were influenced by Sam & Dave. (Their biggest hit was a cover of \"Soul Man\" and their act and stage show had many similarities to the duo.)  \n\n[edit] Early years \n\nSam Moore and Dave Prater's early musical backgrounds involved listening to and singing gospel music in their homes and churches, and in Dave's case, also singing gospel in the choir in his church. Dave later sang with his older brother JT Prater in the gospel group The Sensational Hummingbirds, which recorded the record \"Lord Teach Me\" in the 1950s. Sam recorded \"Nitey-Nite\"/\"Caveman Rock\" in 1954 with the doo-wop group The Majestics, and later sang with the gospel groups The Gales and The Mellonaires. Moore and Prater listed Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke as influences on their styles,[2] and Moore was also influenced by Little Willie John, whom he and Dave opened for often in the early 1960s.\n\nSam & Dave met working the gospel music circuit, and later in small clubs in Miami during amateur nights in 1961 according to Dave.[3] They sang together one night at the King of Hearts club, and started working together immediately thereafter, developing a live act featuring gospel-inspired call-and-response. Soul singer and record producer Steve Alaimo discovered them while performing on the same show with them at the King of Hearts nightclub in Miami and signed them to Marlin Records.\n\nAfter two singles in early 1962 were released on the local Marlin label owned by Miami's Henry Stone, Stone helped sign them to Roulette Records in New York. They released six 45s from 1962–1964 (two were re-releases of Marlin recordings) with Roulette, and one single on Stone and Alaimo's Alston Label. A few of the singles received regional airplay, but did not achieve national chart success. The songs, some of which were produced by Steve Alaimo and some of which were produced by Henry Glover,were similar in many ways to r&b recordings by Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John. Prater was the lead vocalist on most of these singles, with Moore singing harmony and alternate verses.\n\nIn summer 1964, Stone introduced the duo to Atlantic Records' Jerry Wexler, who signed them to Atlantic.[4] Wexler asked Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, which Atlantic distributed nationally, to work with Sam & Dave. Wexler wanted the Southern roots and gospel style of their live performances, so the pair were loaned to Stax to record, although they remained Atlantic Records artists. According to Wexler's autobiography Rhythms & Blues, \"Their live act was filled with animation, harmony and seeming goodwill. I put Sam in the sweet tradition of Sam Cooke or Solomon Burke, while Dave had an ominous Four Tops' Levi Stubbs-sounding voice, the preacher promising hellfire.\"\n[edit] The Stax years (1965–1968)\n[edit] Arrival at Stax and early Stax singles\n\nWhen Sam & Dave arrived at Stax, they worked with producer & engineer Jim Stewart and songwriters including the MGs' guitarist Steve Cropper, who wrote or co-wrote four of their first eight recordings. The duo then moved to relative newcomer writers and producers Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Hayes and Porter wrote and produced the duo's biggest hits (although they did not receive production credits until the Soul Men LP and singles). According to Moore and Prater, they also greatly influenced the duo's singing style,[5] and had them shift their recording style from the style of their Roulette records to a more live, more energetic gospel, call-and-response feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today.\n\nSam & Dave's Stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at Stax. The Stax house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and the Stax horn section, the Mar-Keys had world-class musicians who co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed to recordings—the same musicians who recorded with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Carla Thomas and other soul artists. Sam & Dave's Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder Jim Stewart, who created the Memphis Sound by recording live in a single take. Stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental separation and the distinct contribution of each instrument to the overall feel of the song. Hayes and Porter are in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, The Mar-Keys are in the Musicians Hall of Fame, and Booker T. & the MG's, Jim Stewart, Isaac Hayes and Sam & Dave are all in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile the first two Stax singles failed to chart, the third, the Hayes/Porter composition (with similarities, including the title, to a gospel standard) \"You Don't Know Like I Know\" hit #7 R&B in 1966. This was the first of 10 consecutive Top Twenty R&B chart hits over three years, and 14 R&B chart appearances during their career.\n[edit] \"Hold On, I'm A-Comin'\" single and Hold On I'm Comin' LP\n\n\"Hold On, I'm A-Comin\" (R&B#1/Pop#21), released in March 1966, was a monster R&B hit for Sam & Dave, and also their first single to break into the Top 40 Pop charts. The song was named the #1 song of the year for 1966 by the Billboard R&B charts, and spent 20 weeks on the R&B charts in 1966, peaking at #1 in June. In 1988, Rolling Stone named it one of the best 100 songs of the past 25 years. \"Hold On, I'm A-Comin'\" received a belated RIAA gold record for one million sales in 1995, 29 years after its release.[6] \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" has since been recorded by over 28 other artists.\n\n\"Hold On, I'm Comin\" was also the first recording on which Moore took lead on the first verse and the deeper, rougher voiced Prater was given the response role and second verse at Hayes and Porter's suggestion. The duo used this format, or singing dual leads, on most of their songs. The song was created when Hayes called to Porter, who was in the bathroom. Porter supposedly said \"Hold on, man, I'm comin'\", and Hayes and Porter had the song written in 10 minutes.[6] \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\", when released, received objections from radio stations over the suggestive title. This resulted in a name change by Stewart and quick re-recording and re-release, and nearly all the original U.S. copies of the single bear the title \"Hold On, I'm A-Comin'\".\n\nThe LP Hold On, I'm Comin' (4/66) reached #1 during 19 weeks on the R&B album charts in 1966. After Sam & Dave's chart success, Roulette quickly released the album Sam & Dave in 1966 as well, a collection of the A & B sides of their six Roulette 45s, which did not chart.\n[edit] When Something is Wrong, Double Dynamite LP and singles\n\nSam & Dave's next huge R&B hit was \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\", their only ballad single, which was released in January 1967. Stax author Rob Bowman called this \"One of the most sublime records in soul music's history\", and Mar-Keys trumpet player Wayne Jackson called it the greatest song he has ever heard. This was the only Sam & Dave hit where Dave sang the first verse solo; their other hits started with Sam & Dave together or Sam singing the first verse. \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" has since become an often recorded and performed duet for male and female singers performing together.\n\nIn the later part of 1966, Sam & Dave also charted with the top 10 R&B hits \"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody\", and \"You Got Me Hummin\". These three singles, along with other tracks, were compiled on Double Dynamite (12/66), Sam & Dave's second LP on Stax. The LP peaked at #7 R&B and #118 Pop.\n[edit] \"Soul Man\" single and Soul Men LP\n\nSam and Dave's biggest hit and best remembered song, \"Soul Man\"(R&B #1/Pop #2), was released in August 1967. It was the number #1 song in the US according to Cashbox magazine Pop charts in November 1967. Sam & Dave won the Grammy Award in 1967 for \"Best Performance - Rhythm & Blues Group\" for \"Soul Man\", their first gold record. \"Soul Man\" was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The song helped popularize the term to describe the emerging music genre \"Soul Music\" that would be so popular in the late 1960s. According to co-writer Isaac Hayes, the title was inspired by news reports of soul pride that emerged after the 1967 race riots, where stories that painting the word \"soul\" on your door was a message for looters to bypass your house. Hayes-Porter extrapolated that to \"I'm a soul brother, I'm a soul man.\". It has been recognized as one of the best or most influential songs of 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Rolling Stone, and R.I.A.A. Songs of the Century. \"Soul Man\" was used as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film, a 2008 film Soul Men, a 1997–1998 television series.\n\nThe Soul Men LP (October 1967) was Sam & Dave's third Stax LP, reaching #5 on the R&B charts and #68 Pop.[7] Musicologist Rob Bowman called Soul Men One of the greatest soul music albums of all time.\" \"Don't Knock It\" from the LP was released as a single in France, but other songs were not released as U.S. singles due to the long run by \"Soul Man\" on the Pop charts (15 weeks), by which time \"I Thank You/Wrap it Up\" was ready for release. \"May I Baby\", the b-side of \"Soul Man\", is also regarded as a classic non-hot 100 song on the LP by Whitburn's \"Top Pop Singles\" guide, and was a popular live song performed frequently by Sam & Dave.\n[edit] \"I Thank You\" single and I Thank You LP\n\nThe first single for Sam & Dave in 1968 was \"I Thank You/Wrap it Up\" (R&B #4/Pop #9). It is one of many gospel-inspired tunes and was a hit on both charts. Critics commented that the B side \"Wrap it Up\" could have been a separate successful single, which it later became for The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Sam & Dave were so busy touring at this point that Hayes & Porter travelled to Europe where Sam & Dave were touring to record the vocal track on \"Wrap it Up\" so they could release the single. Due to the end of the distribution agreement between Stax and Atlantic Records in May 1968, \"I Thank You\" was Sam and Dave's final single on Stax. Although they continued to work at Stax with Hayes/Porter, as of May 1968, the duo's work was released on Atlantic Records. \"I Thank You\" sold over one million copies, and was another to earn gold disc status.[8]\n\nSam and Dave's first 1968 single for Atlantic was \"You Don't Know What You Mean To Me\", written by Eddie Floyd and Steve Cropper. Sam and Dave said it was their favorite of their songs,[9] and the single charted #48 Pop and #19 R&B. Sam & Dave also released \"Can't You Find Another Way (of Doing It)\" which charted at #54 Pop and #20 R&B, but which was not included in the I Thank You LP. Their final single of 1968, \"Everybody Got To Believe In Somebody\", charted in the lower levels of the pop charts and ended Sam and Dave's streak at ten straight R&B top 20 singles.\n\nThough on Atlantic, the I Thank You LP (10/68) included 1968 singles initially on both Stax and Atlantic. The LP peaked at #38 on the R&B charts, and was the only LP of their Stax recordings not to chart on the Pop LP charts.[10]\n[edit] Sam & Dave's live performances\n\nSam & Dave's live act earned them the nickname \"Double Dynamite\". Phil Walden, Otis Redding's manager, said \"I think Sam and Dave will probably stand the test of time as being the best live act that there ever was. Those guys were absolutely unbelievable. Every night they were awesome.\" An October 1968 Time article reads: \"Of all the R & B cats, nobody steams up a place like Sam & Dave ... weaving and dancing (while singing!), they gyrate through enough acrobatics to wear out more than 100 costumes per year.\" Jerri Hershey described in Nowhere to Run: They carried red suits, white suits, three piece lime green suits, all with matching patent boots and coordinated silk hankies woefully inadequate to absorb a soul man's nightly outpourings. Both Sam & Dave talk a lot about sweat. To Dave, its proof that he's worked for his pay. For Sam its essential, almost mystical. He says he can't work without it. \"Unless my body reaches a certain temperature, starts to liquefy, I just don't feel right without it.\" Wayne Jackson said Sam & Dave left puddles of sweat onstage by the end of a performance.\n\nIn March 1967, Sam and Dave were co-headliners for the Stax/Volt Revue in Europe, which included Booker T & the MGs, The Mar-Keys, Eddie Floyd, Carla Thomas, Arthur Conley and headliner Otis Redding. For Sam & Dave, it was their first time in Europe, largely to all-white audiences, sometimes up to 2,000 people.[11] Although Redding headlined the tour, many agreed Sam & Dave stole the show on many nights. According to Redding's and Sam & Dave's manager Phil Walden, Redding refused to be booked on the same bill with Sam & Dave again, not wanting to have to follow their explosive act. A live version of Sam and Dave's Double Dynamite LP track \"Soothe Me\" was recorded in Paris during the '67 tour. Released as a single in mid-1967, it continued Sam & Dave's string of top 20 U.S. R&B hits and was their first in the UK Top 40.\n\nAfter the tour, Sam & Dave worked as headliners in the U.S. and in Europe in during the Fall of 1967, Fall 1968 and January 1970, and in Japan in 1969 and 1970. Their band grew to 16 pieces and a 35-person entourage with a plane and bus, and they continued to be in demand even as record sales began to drop in late 1969 and 1970. They were doing an average 280 shows per year from 1967 through 1969 and in 1967 only took ten days off for the year. Other high points included headlining the Montreal World's Fair in 1967, performing at the tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr at Madison Square Garden in June 1968, being the first black Soul act to headline the Fillmore East in December 1968, and headlining the Texas International Pop Festival for two nights in August 1969. Sam & Dave also performed on U.S. and European television, including two appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1969, appearing on The Tonight Show and American Bandstand in 1967, and performing on The Mike Douglas Show in 1969 and 1970. Moore frequently recalls the Sullivan Show performances as a career highlight.\n[edit] The Atlantic Records years (1968–1972)\n[edit] Best of LP, Stax recorded singles (1969)\n\nThe year 1969 started well, with the Atlantic release of The Best of Sam & Dave LP in January. It contained all their Stax A sides except \"A Place Nobody Can Find\" and several B-sides, and peaked at #24 on the R&B LP charts and #89 on the Billboard LP charts.[12] Their first single of the year, \"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar\", returned Sam and Dave to the R&B top 20, and was a #15 hit in the UK.[13] The follow-up \"Born Again\", reached the lower levels of the charts, and was the last single Sam and Dave recorded at Stax.\n[edit] Atlantic produced records, first break-up, and reunion (1969–1972)\n\nJerry Wexler with co-producer Tom Dowd tried producing Sam & Dave in New York, with Atlantic songwriters and musicians. It took eight months to issue the first Atlantic single in August 1969, \"Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\", a long time in that era. It was not a very good record, by Sam's own admission, and the first time in four years that a Sam & Dave single failed to chart.\n\nTwo more singles followed in 1970, \"Baby, Baby, Don't Stop Now\", and \"One Part Love, Two Parts Pain\". The first was a leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive Al Bell and Allen Jones. Both failed to hit the US R&B charts or the Hot 100. According to Wexler, \"We just made some shit-ass records with them. I never really got into their sensibilities as a producer\".[14] Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford for their next single \"Knock It Out The Park\", which failed to chart.\n\nSam & Dave split up in June 1970, according to Moore[15] as a result of Moore's dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo. According to Prater, they broke up because \"[Moore] decided to do what he wanted to do on his own.\" Moore recorded three solo singles (none of which charted) for Atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by King Curtis, which was shelved after Curtis was stabbed to death in 1971. Prater recorded a single for Alston. Neither was commercially successful as a solo act, and they reunited in August 1971.\n\nIn October 1971, their last Atlantic single, \"Don't Pull Your Love\", was a cover of a hit by Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds. This Shapiro/Crawford production was a minor hit (R&B #36/Pop #102), but not a substantial enough commercial success to keep the duo signed to the label. Sam & Dave made their final Atlantic recordings in August 1972, four songs never released by the label. Their contract with Atlantic expired shortly thereafter.\n[edit] Later years (1972–1981)\n\nDespite inability to attract a major label after Atlantic, there was still demand for public performances, especially in Europe.[16] They toured Turkey in Spring 1972 and England in Spring 1973. Sam & Dave also continued to be visible in the U.S., performing on TV shows including The Midnight Special and The Mike Douglas Show. According to Sam, most U.S. shows in the 70s were small clubs, oldies shows, and whatever they could get. Sam & Dave's poor relationship with each other and rumours of drug use at this point were well known within the music industry and contributed to the limited ability to get high quality bookings, also, according to Sam. According to Jerri Hirshey, who saw them many times in the 1970s, their shows could range anywhere from incredible, to horrible.\n\nSam and Dave returned to the studio in 1974-5, recording an album of new songs titled Back at Cha for United Artists. The album – their first album of new material in 7 years – was produced by Steve Cropper, and featured the MGs and The Memphis Horns and had a minor R&B single, \"A Little Bit of Good\" (R&B #89). Songwriters included Cropper, Allen Toussaint, and Jimmy Cliff.[17] Although the LP received positive reviews, it failed to chart. In a side project, they provided vocals on \"Come On, Come Over\" for Jaco Pastorius for his debut album on Epic in 1976.\n\nIn 1976-77, Sam & Dave recorded songs in the UK with producer John Abbey. Two singles were released on Abbey's Contempo label in the UK and Germany, with limited success. Ironically, given the duo's disputes, one of the last singles by Sam & Dave was a cover of The Beatles \"We Can Work It Out\". Sam & Dave also briefly retired in 1977, with Dave working at a Pontiac dealership in New Jersey and Sam working at an Austin, Texas, law firm as a process server.\n\nIn 1978, Sam & Dave re-recorded old hits for the LP \"Sweet & Funky Gold\" (Gusto), and re-recorded songs and other soul hits during this period in Nashville for an album for K-Tel Records, The Original Soul Man.[18] In Summer 1978, they toured Germany for two weeks.\n\nIn 1979, Sam & Dave enjoyed a significant resurgence of interest as a result of Dan Aykroyd's and John Belushi's sketch characters in the cult film The Blues Brothers, and The Blues Brothers' 1979 top 40 cover of \"Soul Man\". Moore stated they were offered an opportunity to perform onstage with Belushi and Aykroyd on SNL, but turned it down when Belushi said Sam & Dave had to perform the intro, then the Blues Brothers would take over. The Blues Brothers' personas and stage act were influenced by Sam & Dave, according to an April 1988 interview with Aykroyd in the Chicago Sun-Times. Aykroyd saw Sam & Dave as a teenager at the Montreal Expo in 1967, and said they were one of his biggest influences. Aykroyd got director John Landis to include the Jake and Elwood Blues characters listening to \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" and \"Soothe Me\" while riding in the Bluesmobile during the film as a tribute to Sam & Dave.\n\nAlso in 1979, Sam and Dave opened shows for The Clash on their U.S. tour, including at the Palladium in New York City. In 1980, the duo performed in Paul Simon's film One Trick Pony and on Saturday Night Live. In 1980, they also were featured in a U.S. tour opening for the 50s band Sha Na Na.\n\nIn 1981, they re-recorded many hits along with Sam Cooke and Otis Redding covers for LPs titled Soul Study Vol. 1 and Soul Study Vol. 2 (Odyssey). The pair last performed on New Year's Eve, 1981, at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. According to Moore, when they walked off stage it was the last time they spoke to each other.[19]\n[edit] Dave Prater and Sam Daniels (1982–1988)\n\nIn 1982, Prater started touring under the \"Sam & Dave\" name or as \"The New Sam & Dave Revue\" with Sam Daniels, who performed with Dave from October 1982 until Dave's death in 1988. Moore attempted to block Prater from using the group's name,[20] but was largely unsuccessful. The Daniels & Prater incarnation played 100 shows per year over the next seven years, including in Europe, Japan and Canada.\n\nIn 1985, Prater and Sam Daniels released a newly-sung medley of Sam & Dave hits recorded in The Netherlands, which peaked at #92 R&B and was credited to \"Sam & Dave\". Sam Moore got the record company to recall the single for using the \"Sam & Dave\" name without permission, and the record was re-labelled and re-issued by \"The New Sam & Dave Revue\".[21]\n\nPrater had his last performance with Sam Daniels on April 3, 1988 at a Stax Reunion at the Atlanta Civic Center which also featured Isaac Hayes, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus and Carla Thomas. Six days later, on April 9, 1988, Prater died in a car crash in Sycamore, Georgia, while driving to his mother's house.\n\nSee more details on his career under his Dave Prater Wikipedia bio.\n[edit] Sam Moore solo career (1982-present)\n\nMoore has continued to perform and record as a solo artist, and has also performed in numerous duets with other popular artists. (See the Sam Moore article.)\n[edit] Conflict between Moore and Prater\n\nSam & Dave were also famous for having a very tumultuous partnership during most of their 21 years together. According to Moore, they did not speak to each other offstage for almost 13 years. During the 1970s, they broke up many times, and would typically show up separately for shows, require separate dressing rooms, not look at each other onstage, and communicate through intermediaries.[22] They also had performances in the 1970s where only one of them would show up. Moore describes personal issues with Prater, drug use, touring fatigue, and a desire to do his own act with new material as contributing to their break-up.[15] Prater attributed their rift and break-ups to Moore's frustrations in wanting to do his own act and diversify from having to perform the Sam & Dave song catalogue (which Moore has often stated that he does not like very much) over and over.[3]\n[edit] Covers by other artists/use in pop culture\n\nSam & Dave songs have been recorded by other artists, including 29 covers of \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\". Others who charted with Sam & Dave songs include ZZ Top -\"I Thank You\", The Fabulous Thunderbirds -\"Wrap It Up\", James & Bobby Purify -\"I Take What I Want\", Linda Ronstadt featuring Aaron Neville -\"When Something is Wrong with my Baby\", Chuck Jackson & Maxine Brown -\"Hold On, I'm Comin'\", and Lydia Pense & Cold Blood -\"I Take What I Want\". A diverse group of other successful artists also recorded Sam & Dave covers including: Aretha Franklin, Elvis Costello, Peter Frampton, The Temptations, Bonnie Raitt, Jackie Wilson, The Eurythmics, Rory Gallagher, Tom Jones, The Band, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas, Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle & Travis Tritt, Bryan Ferry, Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr., The Hollies, Paul Butterfield, Taj Majal, Guy Sebastian, and Eric Clapton & B.B. King.[23]\n\nIn 2003, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music opened in Memphis and Sam & Dave are in the film made for the Museum, titled Soulsville, and have a permanent wall and video display.\n\nBarack Obama used \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" as a theme song on the campaign trail, until Sam Moore requesting he stop using it. 11 months later Sam Moore performed \"Soul Man\" with Sting and Elvis Costello at one of Obama's inaugural parties. A parody of \"Soul Man\" created by Moore, \"I'm a Dole Man\", was used in the 1996 Bob Dole presidential campaign until the copyright owners objected and requested the campaign stop using it. Sam & Dave released the rare single \"Hold on, Edwin's Coming\" in 1982 to support Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards' third run for Governor. Another parody, \"I'm a Suns Fan\", was recorded by Moore and used for the Phoenix Suns basketball games.\n\nSam & Dave songs have been frequently used in movie & TV soundtracks and commercials, including \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" on the soundtrack of the 2007 hit film American Gangster. \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" and \"Soothe Me\" played on the radio in the Bluesmobile during the 1980 hit movie and cult classic, The Blues Brothers. Jay Leno used \"Hold on I'm Comin\" while driving his AC Cobra on his 2009 Super Bowl commercial to announce his show's move to 10pm. \"Wrap it Up\" is used as a transition to commercial break for The O'Reilly Factor. \"Soul Man\" was used as the title and title track in the 1986 movie featuring C. Thomas Howell, and also the 1997–1998 television series featuring Dan Aykroyd. The movie Tapeheads, released in 1988 and starring John Cusack and Tim Robbins, featured Sam Moore and Junior Walker as a fictitious, legendary soul duo called \"The Swanky Modes\". The movie Soul Men, released in November 2008, was a comedy featuring Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson as two feuding soul singers called \"The Real Deal\". In February 2009, Moore filed suit against the film production company and the producers for infringing on the marks Soul Man and Soul Men, claiming the movie is based on the careers of Sam & Dave, and damaged both Moore's reputation and career.\n[edit] Discography\n[edit] Studio albums\n\n    * 1966: Hold On, I'm Comin' (Stax 708) (POP #45, R&B #1)\n    * 1966: Double Dynamite (Stax 712) (POP

  "Sam Baker": {
    "bio": "There are at least two artists by this name:\n\n1. Sam Baker was a black Southern Soul artist born 1941 in Jackson, MS, who began his career singing secular music rather than in gospel like most other of his kind at the time.  However, he was influenced by gospel as well as blues performers, and performed with the likes of Jimmy Reed, Clyde McPhatter, and others early in his career. He went on to become one of the memorable artists on the legendary Sound Stage 7 label, releasing more sides for the label than any other artist except Joe Simon. The Soulscape reissue label recently re-released this SS7 material on CD. The streamable tracks on this page are a few of his cuts. Sam was also known as Lord Sam Baker when John R and Hoss Allen and others would play his records on WLAC deep in the heart of Dixie,  Nashville, TN.\n\n2.: Sam Baker is a country singer-songwriter out of Austin, Texas. Here’s a man who can’t really sing, but mostly just speaks. Who’s deaf on one side, partially deaf on the other. And who can’t use all his fingers while playing guitar anymore. And yet Sam Baker manages to make what has got to be one of the finest Americana albums in recent years. He believes in storytelling and that everyone is at the mercy of another one's dream.

  "Sam Cooke": {
    "bio": "Samuel Cooke (born January 22, 1931 in Clarksdale, Mississippi; died December 11, 1964 in Los Angeles, California) was a popular and influential American gospel, R&B, soul, and pop, songwriter and singer,  recognized as one of the true founders of soul music. Often referred to as The King of Soul, Cooke had 29 Top 40 hits in the U.S. between 1957 and 1964 including major hits You Send Me, A Change Is Gonna Come, Chain Gang and Wonderful World. Cooke was also among the first modern black performers and composers to attend to the business side of his musical career, he founded both a record label and a publishing company as an extension of his careers as a singer and composer. He also took an active part in the American Civil Rights Movement.\n\nOn December 11, 1964, Cooke was allegedly shot to death by the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California at the age of 33. At the time, the courts ruled that Cooke was drunk and distressed, and the manager killed Cooke in what was later ruled a justifiable homicide. Since that time, the circumstances of his death have been widely questioned.\n\nSam Cooke (he added an \"e\" onto the end of his name because he thought it added a touch of class)  was one of eight children of Rev. Charles and Mrs. Annie Mae Cook. The family moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1933.\n\nCooke began his musical career as a member of a quartet with his siblings, the Singing Children, followed by a turn as a teenager as a member of the Highway QCs, a gospel group. In 1950, at the age of 19, he joined The Soul Stirrers and achieved significant success and fame within the gospel community.\n\nHis first pop single, \"Lovable\" (1956) was released under the alias of \"Dale Cooke,\" in order to not alienate his fan base; there was a considerable taboo against gospel singers performing secular music. However, the alias failed to hide Cooke's unique and distinctive vocals. No one was fooled. Art Rupe, head of Specialty Records, the label of the Soul Stirrers, gave his blessing for Cooke to record secular music under his real name, but was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and Bumps Blackwell, Cooke's pop producer, were making. Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, Little Richard. When Rupe walked in on a recording session and heard Cooke covering Gershwin, he was quite upset. After an argument between Rupe and Blackwell, Cooke and Blackwell left the label, and Cooke signed with Keen Records in 1957. His first release was \"You Send Me\", which spent six weeks at #1 on the Billboard R&B chart but which also had massive mainstream success, spending three weeks at #1 on the Billboard pop chart.\n\nAs if a R&B performer writing his own songs and achieving mainstream fame was not innovative enough, Cooke continued to astonish the music business in the 1960s with the founding of his own label, SAR Records, which soon included The Simms Twins, The Valentinos, Bobby Womack, and Johnnie Taylor. Cooke then created a publishing imprint and management firm, then left Keen to sign with RCA. One of his first RCA singles was the hit \"Chain Gang.\" It reached #2 on the Billboard pop chart. This was followed by more hits, including \"Sad Mood\", \"Bring it on Home to Me\" (with Lou Rawls on backing vocals), \"Another Saturday Night\" and \"Twistin' the Night Away\".\n\nLike most R&B artists of his time, Cooke focused on singles; in all he had 29 top 40 hits on the pop charts, and more on the R&B charts. In spite of this, he released a critically acclaimed blues-inflected LP in 1963, Night Beat. He was known for having written many of the most popular songs of all time in the genre, and is often uncredited for many of them by the general public.\n\nCooke died at the age of 33 under mysterious circumstances on December 11, 1964 in Los Angeles, California. Though the details of the case are still in dispute (see below), it seems he was shot to death by Bertha Franklin, manager of the Hacienda Motel in South Los Angeles, who claimed that he had threatened her, and that she killed him in self-defense. The verdict was justifiable homicide, though many believe that crucial details did not come out in court, or were buried afterward. Cooke was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California.\n\nSome posthumous releases followed, many of which became hits, including \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", an early protest song which is generally regarded as his greatest composition.\n\nAfter Cooke's death, his widow, Barbara, married Bobby Womack. Cooke's daughter, Linda, later married Bobby's brother, Cecil.\n\nThe song \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was played upon the death of Malcolm X, and was memorably featured in Spike Lee's film Malcolm X. Barack Obama's presidential victory speech paraphrased the song: \"It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.\"\n\nRapper Tupac Shakur references Cooke in a line of the song \"Thugz Mansion\", and Nas references him in the song \"We Major\" with Kanye West. The Roots song \"Stay Cool\" suggests, \"I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke\". Mike Doughty's song \"Sweet Lord in Heaven\" evokes the memory of Cooke, as does the Wallflowers 2000 song \"Sleepwalker\": \"Cupid don't draw back your bow, Sam Cooke didn't know what I know\". The Irish rock-group Jetplane Landing have a song named \"Sam Cooke\".\n\nA fictional version of Cooke (portrayed by Paul Mooney) appeared briefly in the 1978 film, The Buddy Holly Story, leaving the stage at the Apollo Theater before Buddy and The Crickets got on. After being featured prominently in the 1985 film Witness, the song \"Wonderful World\" gained further exposure. \"Wonderful World\" was featured in one of two concurrently running Levi's Jeans commercials in 1985 and became a hit in the United Kingdom because of this, reaching #2 in re-release. Other notable movies that featured his music are Animal House (\"Wonderful World\" and \"Twistin' the Night Away\"), American Werewolf in London, and Cadence (\"Chain Gang\").\n\nCooke's songs \"Bring It on Home to Me\" and \"Change is Gonna Come\" were both featured in the movie Ali. The opening scene of the movie consisted of a live reenactment of \"Bring It on Home to Me\".\n\n\nPosthumous honors\nShortly following his passing, Motown Records released We Remember Sam Cooke, a collection of Cooke covers recorded by The Supremes. \nIn 1986, Cooke was inducted as a charter member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \nIn 1999, Cooke was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked him #16 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\nIn 2008, Cooke was named the fourth \"Greatest Singer of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine.\"\n\nCovers\nJohn Lennon included a medley of two Cooke songs, \"Bring It On Home to Me\" and \"Send Me Some Lovin',\" on his 1975 oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. \nCooke's songs are covered in a tour-available EP from Decemberists frontman, Colin Meloy. It is the third installment of his solo-tour Colin Meloy Sings...! \nJohnny Nash covered the song \"Cupid\" in 1969 with chart success in the US and UK, and it was included as the B-side on some versions of his 1972 hit single I Can See Clearly Now. \nThe Animals covered the song \"Bring It On Home To Me\" in 1965. \nAmy Winehouse also covered the song \"Cupid\" for the BBC Radio 1 album Radio 1 Established 1967. \nBritish soul singer Adele covered the song \"That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On\" as B-side to her single \"Chasing Pavements\" a bonus track for the Asian release of her studio album 19. \nRichard Marx covered \"Bring It On Home To Me\" and \"Wonderful World\" during his earlier concerts. \n\"A Change Is Gonna Come\" has been covered several times. Solo, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, The Fifth Dimension, The Neville Brothers, Otis Redding, The Fugees, Cold War Kids, Seal, Bill Frisell, and The Band featuring the vocals of Rick Danko have all recorded versions of the song. Seal's version debuted on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (Billboard, Nov. 2008) shortly after the election of Obama-Biden. \nGene Vincent, who was a big fan and a close personal friend of Sam Cooke's, recorded \"Another Saturday Night\" in 1964 and \"Bring It On Home to Me\" shortly before his own death in 1971. \nCat Stevens released his Greatest Hits album (1975) with a cover of Sam Cooke's \"Another Saturday Night\", only the second song he released that he didn't write himself. He had also released it as a single (July 12, 1974) which reached No.4 in the U.S. \nCooke was an influence on punk vocalist Mia Zapata of The Gits, who honored him with a cover of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" on their album Enter: The Conquering Chicken. \nIn spring 1965 the British group Herman's Hermits reached no. 5 in the US charts and no.7 in the UK charts with their version of \"Wonderful World\". \nIn 1978, Art Garfunkel, Paul Simon, and James Taylor sang \"Wonderful World\" which hit the Top 40 in the US charts. \nIn 1966, the now cult 60s British pop show Ready Steady Goes Live, the live version of Ready Steady Go!, devoted a whole programme to a live performance of Soul singer Otis Redding, who regularly covered many of Cooke's songs. One of the highlights was a rousing version of \"Shake\" on which Redding was joined by British Soul legends Eric Burdon, lead singer of The Animals, and chart topper Chris Farlowe. \nJimmy Buffett covered \"Another Saturday Night\" on his album Margaritaville Cafe Late Night Menu, in 1993.

    "bio": "Sammy Hagar, From Colton, California, was popular in the early- mid 1980's for fast paced, guitar-driven, hard rock with a masculine, lets-go-party attitude, joined the band Van Halen as lead vocalist after David Lee Roth's departure from the group. (Before joining Van Halen he sang lead vocals in Ronnie Montrose's classic rock band Montrose, and  had some single output, notably his release, \"I Can't Drive 55\".)  As much as it was public surprise when Hagar joined the band, so it was when he left. Sammy Hagar now peddles his own line of high-quality \"Cabo Wabo\" tequila. In the Spring of 2007, Hagar sold his stake in Cabo Wabo tequila to an Italian beverage company for a reported $80 million.\n\nHagar, now a sort of modern-day Jimmy Buffett, has earned his place in rock n roll history as one of hard rock's premier front men who not only has an ample, strong, belting vocal range with soulful melody and tone, but his duality as a formidable lead guitarist and guitar-riff-monger puts him in a league shared with few others in terms of versatility and overall right to rock. \n\nHe now tours with Mike Anthony, former bassist for Van Halen.\n\nHe resides with his family in Mill Valley, CA.\n\nHagar is currently in a band called \"Chickenfoot\" with Michael Anthony, Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith and guitarist Joe Satriani. Their self titled debut album was released to critical acclaim \n\nSammy Hagar is also known as the Red Rocker, due to the fact he almost always wears red shirts or plays a red guitar, or more likely that he has red hair?\n\nSeems that Chickenfoot is on a hiatus as Joe Satriani has gone back to solo and CF has yet to follow up with a new LP.

  "Sarah Vaughn": {
    "bio": "Sarah Lois Vaughan (nicknamed \"Sassy\" and \"The Divine One\") (March 27, 1924, Newark, New Jersey – April 3, 1990, Los Angeles, California) was an American jazz singer, described as \"possessor of one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century\". Jazz critic Leonard Feather called her \"the most important singer to emerge from the bop era.\" Ella Fitzgerald called her the world’s \"greatest singing talent.\" When introduced in her two-part interview of 1980 on The Dick Cavett Show, Cavett quipped (in a takeoff on a well known Sarah Lee product advertising slogan of the time), \"Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody doesn't like Sarah Vaughn.\" During the course of a career that spanned nearly fifty years, she was the singer’s singer, influencing everyone from Mel Torme to Anita Baker. She was among the musical elite identified by their first names. She was Sarah, Sassy -- the incomparable Sarah Vaughan.\n\nSarah Vaughan's father, Asbury \"Jake\" Vaughan, was a carpenter and amateur guitarist. Her mother, Ada, was a laundress. Jake and Ada Vaughan migrated to Newark from Virginia during the First World War. Sarah was their only natural child, although in the 1960s they adopted Donna, the child of a woman who traveled on the road with Sarah Vaughan. The Vaughans lived in a house on Newark's Brunswick street for Sarah's entire childhood. Jake Vaughan was deeply religious and the family was very active in the New Mount Zion Baptist Church on 186 Thomas Street. Sarah began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir and occasionally played piano for rehearsals and service. Vaughan developed an early love for popular music on records and the radio. In the 1930s, Newark had a very active live music scene and Vaughan frequently saw local and touring bands that played in the city. Vaughan initially attended Newark's East Side High School, later transferring to Newark Arts High School, which had opened in 1931 as the United States' first arts \"magnet\" high school.[2] However, her nocturnal adventures as a performer began to overwhelm her academic pursuits and Vaughan dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate more fully on music. Around this time, Vaughan and her friends also began venturing across the Hudson River into New York City to hear big bands at Harlem's Ballroom and Apollo Theater. Vaughan was frequently accompanied by a friend, Doris Robinson, on her trips into New York City. Sometime in the Fall of 1942 (when Sarah was 18 years old), Vaughan suggested that Robinson enter the Apollo Amateur Night contest. Vaughan played piano accompaniment for Robinson, who won second prize. Vaughan later decided to go back and compete herself as a singer. Vaughan sang \"Body and Soul\" and won, although the exact date of her victorious Apollo performance is uncertain. The prize, as Vaughan recalled later to Marian McPartland, was $10 and the promise of a week's engagement at the Apollo. After a considerable delay, Vaughan was contacted by the Apollo in the Spring of 1943 to open for Ella Fitzgerald. \n\nSometime during her week of performances at the Apollo, Vaughan was introduced to bandleader and pianist Earl Hines, although the exact details of that introduction are disputed. Singer Billy Eckstine, who was with Hines at the time, has been credited by Vaughan and others with hearing her at the Apollo and recommending her to Hines. Vaughan spent the remainder of 1943 and part of 1944 touring the country with the Earl Hines big band. This Earl Hines band is best remembered today as an incubator of bebop, as it included trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, saxophonist Charlie Parker (playing tenor saxophone rather than the alto saxophone that he would become famous with later) and trombonist Bennie Green. Eckstine left the Hines band in late 1943 and formed his own big band with Gillespie leaving Hines to become the new band's musical director. Parker came along too, and the Eckstine band over the next few years would host a startling cast of jazz talent: Miles Davis, Kenny Dorham, Art Blakey, Lucky Thompson, Gene Ammons, Dexter Gordon, among others. Vaughan accepted Eckstine's invitation to join his new band in 1944, giving her an opportunity to develop her musicianship with the seminal figures in this era of jazz. Vaughan officially left the Eckstine band in late 1944 to pursue a solo career, although she remained very close to Eckstine personally and recorded with him frequently throughout her life.\n\nVaughan began her solo career in 1945 by freelancing in clubs on New York's 52nd Street like the Three Deuces, the Famous Door, the Downbeat and the Onyx Club. Vaughan also hung around the Braddock Grill, next door to the Apollo Theatre in Harlem. On May 11, 1945, Vaughan recorded \"Lover Man\" for the Guild label with a quintet featuring Gillespie and Parker with Al Haig on piano, Curly Russell on double bass and Sid Catlett on drums. Later that month she went into the studio with a slightly different and larger Gillespie/Parker aggregation and recorded three more sides. After being invited by violinist Stuff Smith to record the song \"Time and Again\" in October, Vaughan was offered a contract to record for the Musicraft label by owner Albert Marx. Vaughan's recording success for Musicraft continued through 1947 and 1948.\n\nIn 1948, a musicians union ban pushed Musicraft to the brink of bankruptcy and Vaughan used the missed royalty payments as an opportunity to sign with the larger Columbia record label. Following the settling of the legal issues, her chart successes continued with the charting of \"Black Coffee\" in the Summer of 1949. During her tenure at Columbia through 1953, Vaughan was steered almost exclusively to commercial pop ballads, a number of which had chart success. Vaughan also achieved substantial critical acclaim. She won Esquire magazine's New Star Award for 1947 as well as awards from Down Beat magazine continuously from 1947 through 1952, and from Metronome magazine from 1948 through 1953.\n\nRecording and critical success led to numerous performing opportunities, packing clubs around the country almost continuously throughout the years of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Vaughan's relationship with Columbia Records also soured as she became dissatisfied with the commercial material she was required to record and lackluster financial success of her records. A set of small group sides recorded in 1950 with Miles Davis and Benny Green are among the best of her career, but they were atypical of her Columbia output. In 1953, her manager-husband, George Treadwell, negotiated a unique contract for Vaughan with Mercury Records. She would record commercial material for the Mercury label and more jazz-oriented material for its subsidiary EmArcy. Her debut Mercury recording session took place in February 1954 and she stayed with the label through 1959. After a stint at Roulette Records (1960 to 1963), Vaughan returned to Mercury from 1964 to 1967.\n\nThe latter half of the 1950s often found Vaughan in the company of a veritable who's who of jazz as she followed a schedule of almost non-stop touring. She was featured at the first Newport Jazz Festival in the Summer of 1954 and would star in subsequent editions of that festival at Newport and in New York City for the remainder of her life. In the Fall of 1954, she performed at Carnegie Hall with the Count Basie Orchestra on a bill that also included Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Lester Young and the Modern Jazz Quartet. That fall, she again toured Europe successfully before embarking on a \"Big Show\" U. S. tour, a grueling succession of start-studded one-nighters that included Count Basie, George Shearing, Erroll Garner and Jimmy Rushing. At the 1955 New York Jazz Festival on Randalls Island, Vaughan shared the bill with the Dave Brubeck quartet, Horace Silver, Jimmy Smith, and the Johnny Richards Orchestra.\n\nAlthough the professional relationship between Vaughan and Treadwell was quite successful through the 1950s, their personal relationship finally reached a breaking point and she filed for a divorce in 1958. Vaughan had entirely delegated financial matters to Treadwell, and despite stunning income figures reported through the 1950s, at the settlement Treadwell said that only $16,000 remained. The couple evenly divided that amount and their personal assets, terminating their business relationship.\n\nThe exit of Treadwell from Sarah Vaughan's life was also precipitated by the entry of Clyde \"C.B.\" Atkins, a man of uncertain background whom she had met in Chicago and married on September 4, 1959. Although Atkins had no experience in artist management or music, Vaughan wished to have a mixed professional/personal relationship like the one she had with Treadwell. She made Atkins her personal manager, although, she was still feeling the sting of the problems she had with Treadwell and initially kept a slightly closer eye on Atkins. Vaughan and Atkins moved into a house in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nWhen Vaughan's contract with Mercury Records ended in late 1959, she immediately signed on with Roulette Records. Vaughan began recording for Roulette in April 1960, making a string of strong large ensemble albums. \n\nVaughan was incapable of having biological children, so, in 1961, she and Atkins adopted a daughter, Debra Lois. However, the relationship with Atkins proved difficult and violent so, following a series of strange incidents, she filed for divorce in November 1963. She turned to two friends to help sort out the financial wreckage of the marriage: club owner John \"Preacher\" Wells, a childhood acquaintance, and Clyde \"Pumpkin\" Golden, Jr. Wells and Golden found that Atkins' gambling and profligate spending had put Vaughan around $150,000 in debt. The Englewood Cliffs house was ultimately seized by the IRS for nonpayment of taxes. Vaughan retained custody of the adopted child and Golden essentially took Atkins place as Vaughan's manager and lover for the remainder of the decade.\n\nAround the time of her second divorce, she also became disenchanted with Roulette Records. Roulette' finances were even more deceptive and opaque than usual in the record business and its recording artists often had little to show for their efforts other than some excellent records. When her contract with Roulette ended in 1963, Vaughan returned to the more familiar confines of Mercury Records. In the Summer of 1963, Vaughan went to Denmark with producer Quincy Jones to record four days of live performances with her trio, Sassy Swings the Tivoli, an excellent example of her live show from this period. The following year, she made her first appearance at the White House, for President Johnson. Unfortunately, the Tivoli recording would be the brightest moment of her second stint with Mercury. Changing demographics and tastes in the 1960s left jazz artists with shrinking audiences and inappropriate material. In 1969 Vaughan relocated to the West Coast, settling first into a house near Benedict Canyon in Los Angeles and then into what would end up being her final home in Hidden Hills. Vaughan met Marshall Fisher after a 1970 performance at a casino in Las Vegas and Fisher soon fell into the familiar dual role as Vaughan's lover and manager. Fisher was another man of uncertain background with no musical or entertainment business experience, but - unlike some of her earlier associates - he was a genuine fan devoted to furthering her career.\n\nThe seventies also heralded a rebirth in Vaughan's recording activity. In 1971, Bob Shad, who had worked with her as producer at Mercury Records, asked her to record for his new record label, Mainstream Records. Basie veteran Ernie Wilkins arranged and conducted her first Mainstream album, A Time In My Life in November 1971. In April 1972, Vaughan recorded a collection of ballads written, arranged and conducted by Michel Legrand. Arrangers Legrand, Peter Matz, Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson teamed up for Vaughan's third Mainstream album, Feelin' Good. Vaughan also recorded Live in Japan, a live album in Tokyo with her trio in September 1973. During her sessions with Legrand, Bob Shad presented \"Send In The Clowns\", a Stephen Sondheim song from the Broadway musical A Little Night Music, to Vaughan for consideration. The song would become her signature, replacing the chestnut \"Tenderly\" that had been with her from the beginning of her solo career. In December 1974, Vaughan played a private concert for the United States President Gerald Ford and French president Giscard d'Estaing during their summit on Martinique. Also in 1974, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas asked Vaughan to participate in an all-Gershwin show he was planning for a guest appearance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. The arrangements were by Marty Paich and the orchestra would be augmented by established jazz artists Dave Grusin on piano, Ray Brown on double bass, drummer Shelly Manne and saxophonists Bill Perkins and Pete Christlieb. The concert was a success and Thomas and Vaughan repeated the performance with Thomas' home orchestra in Buffalo, New York, followed by appearances in 1975 and 1976 with symphony orchestras around the country. These performances fulfilled a long-held interest by Vaughan in working with symphonies and she made orchestra performances without Thomas for the remainder of the decade. In 1977, Vaughan terminated her personal and professional relationship with Marshall Fisher. Although Fisher is occasionally referenced as Vaughan's third husband, they were never legally married. Vaughan began a relationship with Waymond Reed, a trumpet player 16 years her junior who was playing with the Count Basie band. Reed joined her working trio as a musical director and trumpet player and became her third husband in 1978. Also, in 1977 Norman Granz, who was also Ella Fitzgerald's manager, signed Vaughan to his Pablo Records label. Meanwhile, Vaughan and Waymond Reed divorced in 1981.\n\nVaughan remained quite active as a performer during the 1980s and began receiving awards recognizing her contribution to American music and status as an important elder stateswoman of Jazz. A performance of her symphonic Gershwin program with the New Jersey Symphony in 1980 was broadcast on PBS and won her an Emmy Award in 1981. In 1985 Vaughan received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1988 Vaughan was inducted into American Jazz Hall of Fame. After the conclusion of her Pablo contract in 1982, Vaughan did only a limited amount studio recording.  In 1984 Vaughan participated in one of the more unusual projects of her career, The Planet is Alive, Let It Live a symphonic piece composed by Tito Fontana and Sante Palumbo on Italian translations of Polish poems by Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II.\n\nVaughan's final complete album was Brazilian Romance, produced and composed by Sergio Mendes and recorded primarily in the early part of 1987 in New York and Detroit. In 1988, Vaughan contributed vocals to an album of Christmas carols recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with the Utah Symphony Orchestra and sold in Hallmark Cards stores. In 1989, Quincy Jones' album Back on the Block featured Vaughan in a brief scatting duet with Ella Fitzgerald. This was Vaughan's final studio recording and, fittingly, it was Vaughan's only formal studio recording with Fitzgerald in a career that had begun 46 years earlier opening for Fitzgerald at the Apollo.\n\nVaughan is featured in a number of video recordings from the 1980s. Sarah Vaughan Live from Monterrey was taped in 1983 or 1984 and featured her working trio with guest soloists. Sass and Brass was taped in 1986 in New Orleans and also features her working trio with guest soloists, including Dizzy Gillespie and Maynard Ferguson. Sarah Vaughan: The Divine One was featured in the American Masters series on PBS.\n\nIn 1989, Vaughan's health began to decline, although she rarely betrayed any hints in her performances. Vaughan canceled a series of engagements in Europe in 1989 citing the need to seek treatment for arthritis in the hand, although she was able to complete a later series of performances in Japan. During a run at New York's Blue Note jazz club in 1989, Vaughan received a diagnosis of lung cancer and was too ill to finish the final day of what would turn out to be her final series of public performances.\n\nVaughan returned to her home in California to begin chemotherapy and spent her final months alternating stays in the hospital and at home. Toward the end, Vaughan tired of the struggle and demanded to be taken home, where she passed away on the evening of April 3, 1990 while watching a television movie featuring her daughter.\n\nVaughan's funeral was held at the First Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, which was the same congregation she grew up in, although relocated to a new building. Following the ceremony, a horse-drawn carriage transported her body to its final resting place in Glendale Cemetery in Bloomfield, New Jersey.\n\nSarah Vaughan was a three-time Grammy Award winner. The National Endowment for the Arts honored Sarah Vaughan with its highest honor in jazz, the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 1989.

At the risk of sounding like a hippie on a soapbox, music is still powerful and holy and sacred to me. You can turn it into a product and a business, but you can’t start it that way. To me the genesis of a song has to be honest and unassuming. I truly believe that God hands me these gifts and it is my job to translate them as honestly as I can. You have to let a song be what it is. We can’t lose that.

    "bio": "Shawna Lee Colvin better known as Shawn Colvin (born January 10, 1956 in Vermillion, South Dakota) is an American musician. Best known for her hit single \"Sunny Came Home\" from the album \"A Few Small Repairs\".\n\nColvin's formative years were spent in the town of Carbondale, Illinois, where she attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale. She learned to play guitar at the age of 10. Her first public concert was at age 15 at the University of Illinois campus. Colvin cites Joni Mitchell as a primary influence on her music, and her initial performances closely mirrored Mitchell's inflections and guitar tunings.\n\nColvin began working in the music scene in earnest in the late 1970s, first in Austin, Texas and then nationally. She met music partner John Leventhal during this time; Leventhal would go on to be Colvin's producer on several albums. Colvin often lends her talent to contemporaries in the music business - she can be heard singing the backing vocals on the Suzanne Vega hit, \"Luka\" from 1987. Vega returned the favor, singing backup on Colvin's, \"Diamond In The Rough\", from her debut album, \"Steady On\". Colvin, again can be heard singing backing vocals on Mary Chapin Carpenter's, \"The Hard Way\" and \"Come On Come On\" and Mary Chapin returns the favor on Colvin's, \"Climb On (A Back That's Strong)\", from Colvin's \"Fat City\" album.\n\nColvin's first several albums were met with critical acclaim, but did not sell in substantial numbers. After several albums of original work, Colvin released \"Cover Girl\", a collection of cover songs, but the work was a departure for her and was not well received.\n\nColvin experienced breakthrough success with \"A Few Small Repairs\" in October of 1996. The single \"Sunny Came Home\" reached the US Top Ten, and won Grammy Awards for Song and Record of the Year. She has released several subsequent albums that were nominated for Grammys, and has also released a greatest-hits album and a collection of Christmas music.\n\nA new album from Colvin, entitled \"These Four Walls\", was released on September 12, 2006.\n\nShe was the guest vocal artist on the Lisa Loeb single \"Falling in Love\" as well as appearing at various Lilith Fair music festivals. She also has been featured on the popular live music show Austin City Limits and played at the 2003 Austin City Limits Music Festival. She also appeared in a tribute to her idol Joni Mitchell in 2001 that was broadcast on the cable network TNT.\n\nShe has made two guest appearances on The Simpsons as Rachel Jordan, lead singer for a Christian rock band. She first appears in \"Alone Again, Natura-diddly,\" where Rachel wins Ned Flanders' heart after the untimely death of his wife, Maude. Later, in the episode \"I'm Going to Praiseland,\" Ned dates Rachel, only to scare her off when he tries to turn her into a version of Maude.\n\nColvin lives with her daughter, Caledonia, and husband, Mario Erwin in Austin, Texas, and still participates in the Austin music scene.

    "bio": "Shelby Lynne (born Shelby Lynn Moorer, October 22, 1968, Quantico, Virginia) is an American singer, songwriter and actress.\n\nLynne's first recording for Epic was a duet with George Jones, \"If I Could Bottle This Up\", which became a top-50 hit in 1988. In 2000 she won a Grammy award for \"Best New Artist\", despite the fact that she had been recording and releasing records for more than ten years\n\nWith Tears, Lies, and Alibis the follow-up to 2008's Just A Little Lovin' and the first release on her own label, Everso Records, Shelby Lynne affirms her position as a visionary, iconoclastic artist who deftly weaves country, soul, rock, blues, pop and folk influences to forge her own unique style. Like Identity Crisis (2003) and Suit Yourself (2005), this sparse, unguarded collection was produced by Lynne, who evokes a live-in-the-studio vibe from a stellar group of musicians. Born in Quantico, VA, she grew up in Jackson, AL and headed to Nashville at an early age. At 18, Lynne s demos landed her an appearance on TNN s Nashville Now series, which led to a Top 50 duet ( \"If I Could Bottle This Up\" ) with George Jones and a record deal. Following the release of the critically acclaimed I Am Shelby Lynne in 2000, she won the GRAMMY® for Best New Artist. She made her acting debut in 2005, playing Johnny Cash's mother in the Fox Searchlight motion picture Walk the Line.

    "bio": "The Shirelles were an influential American girl group in the early 1960s, and they were the very first girl group to have a number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The members of the quartet were Shirley Owens (who was the lead singer for the most part), Doris Coley, Beverly Lee, and Addie \"Micki\" Harris. The quartet formed in New Jersey in 1958, and went on to release a string of hits including \"Baby It's You\", \"Mama Said\", and the #1 Pop hits \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" and \"Soldier Boy\". Their \"Sha La La\" became an international hit when covered by the British group Manfred Mann, and \"Boys\" was covered by [artsit]the Beatles (Ringo Starr singing lead).The Beatles also covered \"Baby It's You\" on their \"Please Please Me\" album. Although they had no more charting hits after 1967, the Shirelles continued recording for a small but devoted audience well into the 1970s and continued to tour and perform into the early 1980s. In 1968, Coley left the group to remarry and raise her family, and the group continued as a trio. In 1975, she returned only to replace Owens who departed to begin a solo career. On June 10, 1982, after a live concert in Atlanta, Harris succumbed to a heart attack (age 42); she was replaced by Louie Bethune. Shortly, the group went into semi-retirement, though they did accept an invitation to record backup vocals for Dionne Warwick in the late 1980s. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. On February 4, 2000, Coley lost a battle with breast cancer (age 58). The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

  "Sly and the Family Stone": {
    "bio": "Sly & the Family Stone were a band from Vallejo, California, United States. Active from 1966 until 1975, the band was pivotal in the development of soul, funk and psychedelia. Headed by singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and containing several of his family members and friends, the band was the first major American rock band to have an integrated lineup in both race and gender.\n\nBrothers Sly Stone and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone combined their bands (Sly & the Stoners and Freddie & the Stone Souls) at the end of 1966. Sly and Freddie Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham completed the original lineup; Sly and Freddie's sister, singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, joined within a year. This collective recorded five Top 10 hits and four groundbreaking albums, which greatly influenced the sound of American pop music, soul, R&B, funk, and hip hop music. In the preface of his 1998 book For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History, Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly & the Family Stone's influence on African American music by stating \"there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone\". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\nDuring the early 1970s, the band switched to a grittier funk sound, which was as influential on the music industry as their earlier work. The band began to fall apart during this period because of drug abuse and ego clashes; consequently, the fortunes and reliability of the band deteriorated, leading to its dissolution in 1975. Sly Stone continued to record albums and tour with a new rotating lineup under the \"Sly & the Family Stone\" name from 1975 to 1983. In 1987, Sly Stone was arrested and sentenced for cocaine use, after which he went into effective retirement.\n\nSly Stone passed away on June 9th at the age of 82.

  "Solomon Burke": {
    "bio": "Solomon Burke (born March 21, 1940 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, died October 10, 2010 at Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands) was a soul music pioneer and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite releasing numerous rnb chart hits in the 1960s, he never had a Top 20 hit on the pop charts. Burke's influence, however, has outstripped his mainstream commercial success. He is considered a legend of American music.\n\nHe began his adult life as a young preacher in Philadelphia, where he hosted a gospel radio show. In the 1960s, he signed with Atlantic Records and began moving towards more secular music. His first hit was Just Out Of Reach Of My Open Arms, a cover of a country song. Though well-received by both peers and critics, and attaining a few moderate pop and several major R&B hits, Burke never could quite break through into the mainstream as did his contemporaries like Sam Cooke, Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin.\n\nNevertheless, his emotive delivery, polished production, as well as the touches of country and pop sensibility in his music won him admirers and imitators. In 1964 he wrote and recorded Everybody Needs Somebody To Love his most prominent bid for an enduring soul standard. Covered by the Rolling Stones the same year, other well-known versions include one by Wilson Pickett and another a decade and a half later in the 1980 feature film by The Blues Brothers. Burke's biggest hit was a 1969 cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Proud Mary. \n\nHis career was to some degree revived in 2002, with the release of the album Don't Give Up On Me, produced by Joe Henry, where he sang songs written specifically for the album by a roster of top-rank artists, including Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Van Morrison, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Joe Henry himself.\n\nHe is featured in the 2004 movie Lightning in a Bottle singing Turn on Your Love Light and Down in the Valley.\n\nAs of October 2002 Burke was the father of 14 daughters and 7 sons with 64 grandchildren and 8 great grandchildren. Several of his children and grandchildren have had successful careers in various facets of the music industry, though none as much so as their patriarch.\n\nBurke died, arriving at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam where he was supposed to perform with Dutch band De Dijk with whom he recorded an album, entitled Hold on Tight. \n\nRock icon Mick Jagger performed a tribute to Burke at the 2011 Grammy Awards, laying down Burke's classic hit \"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\".  \n\nA cover of Everybody Needs Somebody To Love received huge exposure as the music for Amazon's 2019 Christmas commercial.

    "bioSummary": "Solomon Burke (born March 21, 1940 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, died October 10, 2010 at Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands) was a soul music pioneer and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite releasing numerous rnb chart hits in the 1960s, he never had a Top 20 hit on the pop charts. Burke's influence, however, has outstripped his mainstream commercial success. He is considered a legend of American music.\n\nHe began his adult life as a young preacher in Philadelphia, where he hosted a gospel radio show. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Solomon+Burke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

  "Spencer Wiggins": {
    "bio": "Spencer Wiggins (born 8 January 1942) is an American soul and gospel singer. He is an exponent of so-called \"deep soul\" and is considered one of the best kept secrets of soul music.\n\nWiggins was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where he grew up encouraged by his parents to engage with music, especially gospel; his mother sang in the choir of the Baptist Church where she attended services. He lived in the same area as singers James Carr and Bobby Bland. While at Booker T. Washington High School, he formed a gospel group with his brother Percy and sister Maxine and, on leaving school, formed an R&B group, the Four Stars, that included his brother Percy and David Porter, later to become a leading songwriter and record producer.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he began singing in clubs in Memphis, where he was discovered by Quinton Claunch, head of Goldwax Records. In 1964 Wiggins recorded his first single, \"Lover's Crime\", produced by Claunch, for the label, though his early recordings were licenced for release through the sub-label Bandstand USA. The recording was followed by eight further singles, but none became a hit. His recordings for Goldwax included \"Uptight Good Woman\", written by Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, and \"I Never Loved A Woman (The Way I Love You)\", recorded at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals with guitar by Duane Allman.\n\nIn 1969, after Goldwax collapsed, Wiggins went on to Fame Records, where he recorded two more singles, including \"Double Lovin'\", which reached no.44 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1970. However, other singles for Fame, and for the Pama and Vivid Sound labels, were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1973 Wiggins left Memphis, married, and moved to Miami, Florida, where he became active in the Baptist church and in gospel music. He became a deacon and choir director at the New Birth Baptist Church in Miami, and worked with a number of gospel choirs. He has since released gospel recordings, including Keys To The Kingdom released by Tavette Records in 2003.\n\nThe Japanese label Vivid Sound released a compilation of Wiggins' singles from Goldwax, and in 2006 the Kent label issued another compilation. Due to copyright issues, however, this compilation contains fewer songs than the Japanese release. The album was widely acclaimed and led to Wiggins being seen as one of the greatest unknown soul singers.\n\n  User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

    "bio": "The SteelDrivers is an American bluegrass band from Nashville, Tennessee. Members include fiddler Tammy Rogers, bassist Mike Fleming, guitarist Gary Nichols and banjoist Richard Bailey. The band has recorded two albums on the Rounder Records label and one independent live album recorded at The Station Inn.\n\nAfter playing at bluegrass festivals from around 2005 they signed to Rounder Records and released a self-titled debut in 2008. The album peaked at No. 57 on the U.S. Billboard Top Country Albums chart. The group was nominated for a Grammy award in 2009 for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for their song \"Blue Side of the Mountain.\" In 2010, the group received two nominations for its second album, Reckless. The album has been nominated for both Best Bluegrass Album and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the song \"Where Rainbows Never Die.\"\n\nThe band’s self-titled debut album, released in January of 2008 by Rounder Records, is simply startling: a set of eleven new originals that profoundly resonate with classic bluegrass soul while exploring entirely modern lyrical and harmonic byways.  The blistering, soulful vocals of guitarist and songwriter Chris Stapleton immediately announce that this is dark and dangerous terrain, which the SteelDrivers’ proudly rugged ensemble playing quickly confirms. Fiddler and harmony singer Tammy Rogers knows just when to lay off the notes and let the tone take over, while banjo player Richard Bailey neatly segues from cold modal Stanley-style passages to incisive melodic turns.  Mike Henderson (mandolin) and Mike Fleming (bass) are the SteelDrivers’ engine room, laying out the sparse, driving rhythm on which hangs the songs, mostly co-composed by Stapleton and Henderson. \n\nStapleton’s voice, when melded to his sturdy, vivid songs, immediately distinguishes the SteelDrivers.  It is testament to the value that the SteelDrivers place on quality original songs that band actually formed as a result of the songwriting process.  Henderson and Stapleton are both accomplished Nashville tunesmiths, with innumerable cuts to their credit.  “Chris and I had been writing songs for several years,” Henderson explains.  “We would write a lot of them as though they were bluegrass songs.  But then, when we would get ready to demo them, we would demo them with drums and B-3.  And I was thinking, here’s all these perfectly good songs just sitting around going to waste.”\n\n“My recollection,” continues Stapleton, “is that I went to write at Mike Henderson’s house one night.  And he said, ‘do you want to play some bluegrass?’ I said, sure.  And then next thing I knew, we were in a room with the rest of these guys…”\n\n“These guys” included maverick fiddler and vocalist Tammy Rogers, a longtime fixture on Nashville’s alt-country scene and respected session and touring musician.  “I had kind of done the big left turn into country and Americana, and thought I had left the bluegrass world behind me in charred remnants,” she says.  “So when Mike Henderson called me up and asked me, ‘Do you want to play some bluegrass?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I do.’ And when we all got together, I was just knocked out by the songs, and by Chris’s voice.”\n\nRogers is not the only musician in Nashville taken aback by the band’s charisma, power, chops, and songwriting.  In a short time, the SteelDrivers had worked up three sets of all original material and were performing to capacity crowds at local haunts like the fabled Station Inn.  “I get more inspired listening to their songs, singing, and playing than anything else I've heard in a long time,” raved producer and musician Buddy Miller, while songwriter and guitarist Al Anderson summed up the SteelDrivers succinctly:  “Great band: new and different.  Songs are incredible.  They bring something new to the party.  I love 'em all.  Muscle Shoals meets bluegrass.” \n\nThe band is quick to credit the informal, casually organic nature of their founding.  “We just want to go out and play music that we write and that all of us like,” says Bailey.  “We want to play our kind of music.” \n\nThe SteelDrivers’ brand of bluegrass – intense, dark, poetic, and inescapably human – is a refreshing reminder of the timeless power of stringband music, and is captured perfectly on The SteelDrivers.  Produced by Nashville ace Luke Wooten, The SteelDrivers was recorded mostly live on the studio floor, vocals and all. Its songs grapple with classic themes of regret, love, and redemption, from the escalating prison lament of “Midnight Train to Memphis” to the chilling murderer’s plea encapsulated in “If It Hadn’t Been for Love.”  “East Kentucky Home” is a timeless traditional bluegrass lament, with its strains of homesickness, loss, and abandonment, but ingeniously reinvented with off-kilter rhythmic accents and a decidedly contemporary chord progression. \n\nThe willingness to set aside the unspoken rules that ruthlessly govern bluegrass set the SteelDrivers apart from the innumerable faceless acts vying for the bluegrass spotlight.\n\n“Certainly we want to keep one foot in the bluegrass world—that’s a great thing,” says Tammy Rogers, “but I think our music is broader than just a traditional bluegrass format and that’s what we all hope for it to be.”\n\nThe SteelDrivers are:\n\nRichard Bailey - Banjo\nGrammy nominated banjo player, Richard Bailey has recorded with such diverse artists as Al Green and George Jones.  Featured in the book Masters of the 5-String Banjo, Bailey has performed with Bill Monroe, Roland White, Vassar Clements, Loretta Lynn, Chet Akins, Larry Cordle, Laurie Lewis, Dale Ann Bradley, and countless others.  He has also recorded with Kenny Rogers, Michael Martin Murphy, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette, and Ronnie Milsap and has played at Carnegie Hall and on Austin City Limits. \n\nMike Fleming - Bass/Vocals\nA versatile veteran, Mike Fleming lays down the firm foundation and sings the baritone harmony that rounds out the SteelDrivers’ sound.  A self-confessed “recovering banjo player,” Mike has recorded with Holly Dunn, Joy Lynn White, and with groundbreaking singer/songwriter David Olney.  In addition to traveling the world during stints with Dunn and Kevin Welch, Mike has appeared on Austin City Limits, Nashville Now, Crook and Chase, and too many Grand Ole Opry shows and festivals to count.\n\nMike Henderson - Mandolin/Vocals\nMike Henderson is a veteran songwriter and award-winning musician, with several solo albums on both RCA and Dead Reckoning to his credit.  He has recorded with such artists as Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris, Mark Knopfler, Albert King, Hank Williams, Jr., Johnny Lang, Peter Rowan, Guy Clark, John Hiatt, Sting, Delbert McClinton, Bob Seger, Bo Diddley, Faith Hill, Lucinda Williams, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and many others.  His songs have been recorded by the Dixie Chicks, Kenny Rogers, Daryl Worley, Patty Loveless, Trisha Yearwood, Travis Tritt, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Solomon Burke, Marty Stuart, Gary Allan, and Randy Travis.\n\nTammy Rogers - Fiddle/Vocals\nGrowing up in a family bluegrass band that also included banjo great Scott Vestal, Tammy brings a lifetime of instrumental and vocal experience to the SteelDrivers.  She was also in the legendary pre-Union Station bluegrass band Dusty Miller with Barry Bales, Tim Stafford, Adam Steffey, and Brian Fesler.  No stranger to the studio, she has recorded with Neil Diamond, Wynonna, Rodney Crowell, Radney Foster, Bill Anderson, Iris Dement, Randy Scruggs, Patty Loveless, Buddy and Julie Miller, Jim Lauderdale, and many more.  She has toured the world with Trisha Yearwood, Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless, Maria McKee, and the Dead Reckoners.  Her songs have been recorded by Terri Clarke and Frances Black.\n\nChris Stapleton - Guitar/Vocals\nA rising star on the Nashville scene, Chris Stapleton is a Paintsville, Kentucky native whose powerful “sandpaper to silk” voice gives the SteelDrivers their distinctive sound.  He has recorded with Daryl Worley, Gary Allan, Lee Ann Womack, Trent Wilmon, James Otto, and others, while as a songwriter his compositions have been covered by Tim McGraw, Brooks and Dunn, Julie Roberts, Daryl Worley, Trent Wilmon, Gary Allan, Patty Loveless, Brad Paisley, Trace Adkins, Lee Ann Womack, Montgomery Gentry, and the Lonesome River Band.  He recently scored a number one singles as the writer of “Your Man,” recorded by Josh Turner and Kenny Chesney’s “Never Wanted Nothing More.” User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Steve Earl": {
    "bio": "Steve Earle (born Stephen Fain Earle on January 17, 1955 in San Antonio, Texas) is a singer-songwriter best known for his country music and rock 'n roll tinged \"alt-country.\" He is also a published writer, a keen political activist (particularly in protesting against the death penalty in the U.S., as in his song \"Ellis Unit One\" from the movie Dead Man Walking), and has written and directed a play. Earle also had small roles on the HBO television shows \"The Wire\" and \"Treme\". His sister Stacey Earle is also an acclaimed singer-songwriter, as is his most recent wife, Allison Moorer, whom he wed in 2005. His first son from an earlier marriage is the singer-songwriter Justin Townes Earle, named for Earle's hero Townes Van Zandt.\n\nEarle was born in Fort Monroe, Virginia, and grew up near San Antonio, Texas. His father, Jack Earle, was an air traffic controller. Although he was born in Virginia where his father was stationed, the family returned to Texas before Earle's second birthday. They moved several times but Earle grew up primarily in the San Antonio area.\nEarle began learning the guitar at the age of 11 and placed in a talent contest at his school at age 13. He is reported to have run away from home at age 14 to follow his idol, singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt around Texas. Earle was \"rebellious\" as a youngster and dropped out of school at the age of 16. He moved to Houston with his 19-year-old uncle, who was also a musician, where he married and worked odd jobs. While in Houston Earle finally met Van Zandt, who became his hero and role model.\n\nIn 1975,  at the age of 20, Earle moved to Nashville and began working as a songwriter. In these early days, he recorded with Guy Clark and Emmylou Harris. He finally scored a country hit in 1981, writing Johnny Lee's top ten cut \"When You Fall in Love.\" Earle's early work as a performer tended towards the rockabilly sound, popular at the time. In 1986, his first proper album Guitar Town was a critical and commercial success. It sold over 300,000 copies and led some to herald him as a saviour of country music.\n\nEarle long struggled with drug abuse. His addiction eventually caused a departure from performing and recording after he was dropped by MCA in 1991. Whilst in jail on drug and firearm charges, he kicked the habit and returned to music after his release in 1994.\n\nEarle's \"second, post-jail, musical career\" has been more stylistically diverse than his early material, dipping in acoustic, bluegrass, and roots rock sounds. I Feel Alright and Transcendental Blues met with good reviews and decent sales. 2002's somewhat controversial Jerusalem was one of the first albums to directly address the September 11 attacks. It brought Earle's leftist views to media attention, especially the song \"John Walker's Blues.\"\n\nHis latest album of original material I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive was released in 2011. Songfacts reports that one of the tracks, This City, got played on HBO’s New Orleans based show Treme several months before the album‘s release. Earle, who plays a recurring street musician, composed the song especially for the drama series. \n\nEarle has also  released a tribute album of material written by friend and mentor Townes Van Zandt, entitled Townes.\n\nFor more information and photographs of Steve Earle go to his official website, www.SteveEarle.com.\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Sturgill Simpson": {
    "bio": "John Sturgill Simpson (born June 8, 1978) is an American country music and roots rock singer-songwriter.\n\nSimpson was born in Jackson, Breathitt County, Kentucky, the only child of a secretary and a state policeman who formerly worked undercover narcotics. Due to his father's work, Simpson's family moved to Versailles, outside Lexington, where Simpson graduated from Woodford County High School. Simpson's mother's family were coal miners. Simpson is the first male on his mother's side of the family to not work in a strip mine or deep mine. After three years in the United States Navy, Simpson spent time in Japan, then lived in Everett, Washington, and then moved back home to Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nAs of August 2017, he has released three albums as a solo artist. He released two albums independently, High Top Mountain in 2013 and Metamodern Sounds in Country Music in 2014. His second album is notable for being nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album, being listed 18th on Rolling Stone's \"50 Best Albums of 2014,\" and also being named among \"NPR's 50 Favorite Albums of 2014.\" His third studio album, A Sailor's Guide to Earth, was released on Atlantic Records and was Simpson's first major-label release, later earning him Best Country Album at the 59th Grammy Awards while also being nominated for Album of the Year.\n\nSimpson is often compared to Waylon Jennings and the Outlaw Country genre of country music. Shooter Jennings says, \"Sturgill isn't imitating at all, and he sounds like my favorite era of my dad, the Seventies, when he would sing quieter and more conversational. That's what struck me about Sturgill from Day One. And still does.\" Simpson himself counts Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Keith Whitley, and Marty Robbins as much bigger influences on his sound than Waylon Jennings. Simpson has also stated he tries to base his career around that of Dwight Yoakam. Indeed, Country Music Television noted that Simpson had \"a voice that recalls Merle Haggard [and] guitar licks that bring Buck Owens to mind.\" His overall sound was described by Indiewire as \"a mesmerizing and sometimes bewildering mix of traditional country sounds, contemporary philosophy, and psychedelic recording-studio wizardry.

He has received multiple Grammy awards for his work in film music, including for O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), Cold Mountain (2004), Walk the Line (2005), and Crazy Heart (2010); and won another Grammy for producing the studio album Raising Sand (2007), in which he united the contemporary bluegrass of Alison Krauss with the blues rock of Robert Plant (ex-Led Zeppelin).\n\nBurnett helped start the careers of Counting Crows, Los Lobos, Sam Phillips, and Gillian Welch, and he revitalized the careers of Gregg Allman and Roy Orbison. He produced music for the television programs Nashville and True Detective. He has released several solo studio albums, including Tooth of Crime, which he wrote for a revival of the play by Sam Shepard. \n\nThe only child of Joseph Henry Burnett Jr. and Hazel Perkins Burnett, Burnett was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1948, and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. His grandfather worked as secretary for the Southern Baptist Convention. His father wanted to be a pro athlete and was courted by the Brooklyn Dodgers, but instead, he got a job in Fort Worth with the Tandy Corporation. Burnett was brought up in the Episcopal Church of his mother. He forgot the origin of his nickname, which he uses without a dash.\n\nBurnett discovered music through his parents' 78 RPM phonograph records of Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson, Dinah Washington, and the songs of Cole Porter. He was drawn to music that took him to unconventional places, and he felt no compulsion to stick to one genre. He heard Peggy Lee, Hank Williams, and the Beatles on the radio, was influenced by Buddy Holly, and revered Johnny Cash. He was smitten by the music of Howlin' Wolf, Skip James, the Stanley Brothers, and Jimmy Reed.

He is the son of Linda thompson and Richard Thompson (who famously performed and recorded as Richard & Linda Thompson), and the brother of singer Kami Thompson. His fifth studio album, Bella, was released in 2011.\n\nThompson's style is difficult to categorize, because his influences are varied.  Growing up around folk music, he listened to a musical gamut that covered Hank Williams, Jimi Hendrix, Sam Cooke and gospel.  As he fell in with other musical progeny, most notably close friend Rufus Wainwright, his sound developed into his own combination of country/western, rock, and his father's folk-rock.\n\nThompson played regular shows at Jon Brion's venue, Largo, in Los Angeles, while getting his first album contract together.  He signed with Geffen who had big plans for him - but Geffen was soon after swallowed up by Virgin, who did not. In 2000 Thompson released his debut album, Teddy Thompson, which received much critical acclaim but little commercial success. He took a few years to tour and write before finally recording his second album on his own.  While reviews for his first album were generally positive, the critics have gushed over his second album. Thompson has found his own sound and voice, although his family remains heavily involved in his music.\n\nThompson's fourth album, A Piece of What You Need was released in 2008.

  "The Band": {
    "bio": "The Band was an influential Canadian rock n' roll group in the 1960s and 1970s formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original members were Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, drums, harmonica), Richard Manuel (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone, organ, slide guitar), Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone), Rick Danko (bass guitar, violin, trombone, guitar), and Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, harmonica). \n\nThe members of The Band first worked together as The Hawks, the backing band of rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 until 1963. Afterwards, Bob Dylan recruited the quintet for his history-making 1965/1966 world tour and they joined him on the informal recordings that became the acclaimed Basement Tapes.\n\nDubbed \"The Band\" by their peers, they began recording as a group unto themselves. The Band recorded two of the most important albums of the late 1960s; their 1968 debut Music From Big Pink (featuring the hit single The Weight) and 1969's The Band. These critically praised albums helped conceive country rock as something more than a genre, but rather as a celebration of Americana. \n\nAlthough always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than the general public, The Band has remained an admired and influential group. They have been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Band's music fused many elements, primarily old country music and early rock and roll, though the rhythm section often had a bouncy, funky punch reminiscent of Stax or Motown. Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences. At its best, The Band's music was an organic synthesis of many musical genres which became more than the sum of its parts. The group's songwriting was also remarkable as, unlike much earlier rock and roll, very few of their early compositions were based on conventional blues and doo-wop chord changes.\n\nAll members of The Band were multi-instrumentalists. There was little instrument switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could offer all manner of subtle aural colors and textures to enhance songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax an impressive range of timbres from his Lowrey electronic organ. On the choruses of \"Tears of Rage\", for example, it sounds startlingly like a mellotron. Helm's drumming was rarely flashy, but he was often praised for his subtlety and funkiness. Critic Jon Carroll famously declared that Helm was \"the only drummer who can make you cry,\" while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.\n\nSingers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band. Helm's gritty, southern voice had more than a hint of country, Danko sang in a soaring, unfettered tenor, and Manuel alternated between fragile falsetto and a wounded baritone. The singers regularly blended in unorthodox, but effective harmonies. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared between the three men, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band's 'lead' singer.\n\nRobertson was the chief songwriter who sang lead vocals on only three or four songs in The Band's career. This role, and Robertson's resulting claim to the copyright of most of the compositions, would become a point of much antipathy between the group's members, especially between Robertson and Helm.\n\nProducer John Simon is cited as a 'sixth member' of The Band for producing and playing on Music from Big Pink, co-producing and playing on The Band, and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 album Jericho.\n\nThe Band broke up in 1976, primarily because every member was struggling with drugs, alcohol, or both, and they no longer got along. \"The Last Waltz\", directed by Martin Scorsese,  documented their final performance. \n\nThe Band regrouped in 1983 without founding guitarist and main songwriter Robbie Robertson. They continued as a trio when Richard Manuel died at the age of 42 on March 4, 1986. The reunion albums were Jericho, released in 1993, High on the Hog, released in 1996, and Jubilation, released in 1996. \n\nOn December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at age 56. The loss of Rick resulted in the final end of The Band. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "The Beatles": {
    "bio": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool, Lancashire in 1960. With the line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney,  George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most popular and influential band of all time. The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and socio-cultural movements. \n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, eventually settling with Pete Best in 1960, who played with them for two years before being replaced with then Rory Storm & The Hurricanes drummer Ringo Starr in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein molded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboard's list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard Hot 100. The band received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.\n\nFormer Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original \"... In the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of African-American rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\".\n\nThey not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.\n\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of socio-cultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\n\n\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\"\n\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years. They ranked number one on Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThere are two holidays celebrated for the Beatles: Global Beatles Day on 25 June each year. On that date in 1967, the band performed \"All You Need Is Love\" on television. In 2001, UNESCO created World Beatles Day on 16 January each year. This date has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957.\n\nFive asteroids, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are named after the Beatles.

    "bio": "The Byrds was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. They are considered one of the most important and influential bands of the 1960s. \n\nTheir music bridged the gaps between the socially and spiritually conscious folk music of Bob Dylan, the studio trickery of The Beach Boys, and the sardonic rock of The Beatles. Some of their trademark songs include pop versions of Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man and Pete Seeger’s Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season), and the originals I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better, and Eight Miles High. Throughout their career they helped forge such subgenres as folk rock, raga rock, psychedelic rock, jangle pop, and – on their 1968 classic Sweetheart of the Rodeo – country rock inviting Gram Parsons on rhythm guitar.\n\nThe original and most successful lineup consisted of Chris Hillman, David Crosby, Michael Clarke, Roger McGuinn and Gene Clark. After several line-up changes (with lead singer/guitarist McGuinn as the only consistent member), they broke up in 1973.\n\nIn 1991 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and several band members launched successful solo careers after leaving the group. The most successful was David Crosby who was inducted again for his work with Crosby, Stills & Nash.

  "The Crystals": {
    "bio": "Two artists exist by this name:\n\n1) The Crystals was one of the most successful girl groups of the early 60s, Known for their association with producer Phil Spector, they had several well-remembered hit singles such as \"He's A Rebel\", \"Da Doo Ron Ron\", and \"Then He Kissed Me\". They were also trailblazers for many later African-American pop artists.\n\n2) The Crystals was also the name of an obscure doo-wop group organised by the enigmatic Sun Ra in the mid-50s. Little is known about them. However, their tune \"Honey In The Bee Box\" was featured in the compilation album 'Interplanetary Melodies' on Norton Records, an album which has received critical acclaim.\n\n3). If you are here for the Italian progressive rock band Crystals, they are not \"The Crystals\". Refer to the Crystals band page for more information and please fix your tags.\n\n-------\n\nIn the late 50s, Barbara Alston, Mary Thomas, Delores \"Dee Dee\" Kennibrew, Merna Girard and Patricia \"Patsy\" Wright formed a singing project called \"The Crystals\" in high school. Under the leadership of Alston's uncle, Benny Wells, they wanted to aim for the big time. Soon, the quintet signed with Phil Spector's label Philles Records. Spector then chose Alston to be the group's lead singer, which made her very uncomfortable since she had a fear of singing in front of audiences.\n\nTheir first hit was 1961's \"There's No Other Like My Baby\". This song's B-side \"Oh Yeah, Maybe Baby\" (featuring Wright on lead) and the following single \"Uptown\" were topical and socially-aware pieces about growing up in the ghetto. After the success of \"Uptown\", a pregnant Girard was replaced by Dolores \"LaLa\" Brooks. The next single was 1962's \"He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)\", still widely remembered though only rarely played on the radio due to the touchy subject matter of spousal abuse. Sales were sluggish.\n\nSoon after \"He Hit Me\" flopped, Phil Spector began recording singer Darlene Love and her backing group The Blossoms under the name \"The Crystals\". Legend has it that the real Crystals were not able to travel from New York to Los Angeles fast enough to suit the LA-based Spector, who wanted to quickly record and release \"He's a Rebel\" (written by Gene Pitney) before anyone else had a chance to cover it and have a hit with it. The Crystals were unavailable, but Love and the Blossoms were also based in LA, so Spector recorded them and put the record out under The Crystals' banner.\n\n\"He's A Rebel\" is perhaps the Crystals' most well-remembered and beloved songs, and one of the most enduring of the girl group genre. It was also their only US #1 hit. The follow-up Crystals single, \"He's Sure the Boy I Love\", in actuality also featured Love and The Blossoms.\n\nThe next single credited to The Crystals is one of the rarest -- and also possibly the strangest -- in rock music history. Reports vary as to the actual motivation behind the recording, but most agree that Phil Spector was looking for a way to annoy former business partner Lester Sill. What he came up with was a nearly six-minute song called \"Let's Dance The Screw - Part I\", which would be unplayable on 1963 radio. The record featured simple instrumentation (very much unlike Spector's famous Wall of Sound production style), repetitive lyrics, and Spector himself intoning the lyric \"Dance The Screw\" numerous times in a deadpan monotone. (The B-side, Part II, was more of the same.) The Crystals sang the song's repetitive verses, though it is unclear if these singers were the 'real' Crystals or The Blossoms.\n\nThe single was never commercially released, and only a few copies are known to exist (all marked D.J. COPY - NOT FOR SALE). The record was apparently only created to be a bizarre sort of joke at Sill's expense, as a single copy was specially delivered to him in early 1963. \n\nThough it's unclear as to the level of their participation in \"Let's Dance The Screw\", the 'real' Crystals definitely began recording again under their own name in 1963. However, Thomas had departed to get married which reduced them to a quartet, and Alston stepped down from the lead spot giving it to Brooks.\n\nAfter \"Let's Dance The Screw\", the group's next release was the classic \"Da Doo Ron Ron.\" According to Darlene Love, the track was originally recorded by The Blossoms, with Love on lead vocal. Prior to release, Spector erased Love's lead vocal and replaced it with a vocal by LaLa Brooks, although he kept the Blossoms' backing vocals in place. The song was a top 10 hit in both the US and the UK, as was the follow-up single \"Then He Kissed Me\" — the first Crystals single since \"He Hit Me\" to feature all members of the Crystals as a definite group.\n\nBoth \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" and \"Then He Kissed Me\" were penned by Spector with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich.\n\nDespite the steady flow of hit singles, tensions between Spector and the Crystals mounted. Already unhappy with having been replaced by Love and company on two singles, The Crystals were even more upset when in 1964, Spector began focusing much of his time on rival girl group The Ronettes. Two failed Crystals singles followed, before the band left Spector's Philles Records for Imperial Records later in 1964. 1964 also saw the departure of Wright who was replaced by Frances Collins; toward the end of that year Alston departed leaving the group a trio. They disbanded in 1966. They reunited in 1971 and toured widely in varying incarnations on the oldies circuit; they still occasionally perform today. Kennibrew is the only original Crystal who remained active throughout their touring from the seventies to the present.\nLead singer Barbara Alston (September 28, 1943 – February 16, 2018) died at a Charlotte hospital in 2018.

  "The Dells": {
    "bio": "The Dells were an American doo-wop group. Formed in high school in 1952 in Harvey, Illinois by founding members Marvin Junior, Verne Allison, Johnny Funches, Chuck Barksdale, and Mickey and Lucius McGill, under the name The El Rays. They released their first recording in 1954 and two years later had their first R&B hit with \"Oh What a Nite\". After disbanding due to a near-fatal car crash in 1958, the band reformed in 1960 with Funches being replaced by Johnny Carter. This lineup remained together until Carter's death in 2009. In 2004 The Dells were inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. The group performed until illness forced longtime lead singer Marvin Junior and bass vocalist Chuck Barksdale into retirement, ending the group's 60-year run.\n\nThe Dells grew up in Harvey, Illinois and began singing together while attending Thornton Township High School. Forming in 1952 under the name the El-Rays, the group initially consisted of Marvin Junior, Mickey McGill, Lucius McGill, Verne Allison, Chuck Barksdale, and Johnny Funches. Lucius soon left the group and the remaining quintet signed with Checker Records, releasing their first single, \"Darling I Know,\" which flopped.\n\nIn 1955, the group renamed themselves the Dells and signed with Vee-Jay Records. In 1956, they recorded their first hit, \"Oh, What a Nite\" (a song co-written by Johnny Funches, who also sang lead on the recording alongside Marvin Junior), which hit the Top 5 of the R&B singles chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song is ranked #260 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In November 1958, the Dells suffered a car accident that left McGill in a hospital in Ohio for six months. The group temporarily disbanded and Barksdale sang as a member of Harvey Fuqua's spinoff Moonglows act, Harvey and the Moonglows, which included a young Marvin Gaye. In 1961, the Dells reunited and auditioned for Dinah Washington. After Washington agreed to hire them, Johnny Funches left the group to take care of his family. Funches was replaced by Flamingos founding member Johnny Carter and sang background for Washington for two years. In 1966, they were hired to open for Ray Charles, only to be fired after a performance resulted in several standing ovations. The group would also sing background for Barbara Lewis, mainly on Lewis' 1963 hit, \"Hello Stranger\", while also working with Quincy Jones, who helped to fine-tune their vocals for standards and jazz material.\n\nIn 1966, the Dells returned to Chess under the label's Cadet subsidiary working with Bobby Miller and future Earth, Wind & Fire arranger Charles Stepney. In 1967, the Dells issued the album There Is which included their first R&B chart-topper in years with the title track, which showcased the sharp baritone of Marvin Junior and the harmonies with the four other Dells. The song was also their first top 20 pop hit.\n\nSubsequent R&B hits included \"Wear It on Our Face,\" \"Always Together\" (Top 20 Pop, \"I Can Sing a Rainbow - Love is Blue (medley)\" (UK #15), and their first #1 R&B hit and first Top Ten pop hit, 1968's \"Stay in My Corner,\" which reached #10 on the pop chart and showcased both Carter and Marvin in lead vocals. In the following year, 1969, The Dells' soulful remake of their debut hit, \"Oh What a Night\" gave the group their second chart-topping R&B single and also reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. For a second time, the song sold over a million copies. Subsequent hits included \"Open Up My Heart,\" \"Oh What A Day,\" and \"On the Dock of the Bay.\" In 1971, the Dells' \"The Love We Had Stays on My Mind\" became another Top Ten hit on the R&B charts, also reaching the pop Top 30. By this time Charles Stepney had taken over production duties from Bobby Miller. 1973's \"Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation\" was their third certified gold record. The song was written by L.V. Johnson and produced by Don Davis.\n\nLeaving Cadet around the end of 1974 with the parent company in financial difficulties, the group would continue recording in order under the Mercury, ABC, and Virgin labels finding some hits, including 1980's \"I Touched a Dream\", which returned the group to the top 40 on the R&B charts. The Dells were confined mostly to the oldies market afterwards until they were asked to be creative consultants to Robert Townsend's acclaimed 1991 film, The Five Heartbeats, which was loosely based on the lives of The Dells and other groups of its era. The group recorded a composition titled \"A Heart Is a House for Love\". The song reached number 13 on the Billboard R&B chart, making them only one of two groups to have hit singles in five decades. The following year, signing with PIR, they released the album, I Salute You. The Dells continued performing and recording sporadically in the early years of the new millennium. In 2004, the group were inducted to both the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group continued performing until 2012.\n\nOriginal Dells vocalist Johnny Funches died of pneumonia on January 23, 1998, at the age of 62.\n\nJohnny Carter died of cancer on August 21, 2009, at the age of 75. Carter is one of the few artists to be a double Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, having been inducted with The Flamingos in 2001, and the Dells in 2004.\n\nOn May 29, 2013, founding member Marvin Junior died in his sleep at his home in Harvey, Illinois, succumbing to complications of kidney failure and a weak heart at the age of 77.\n\nChuck Barksdale died on 15 May 2019, at the age of 83.\n\nMembers\nMarvin Junior (born Marvin Curtis Junior, January 31, 1936, Harrell, Arkansas – May 29, 2013) - lead baritone, lead vocals (1952-1958, 1960–2012)\nVerne Allison (b.

  "The Dominoes": {
    "bio": "Billy Ward and His Dominoes were one of the top American R&B groups of the 1950s, and launched the careers of both Clyde McPhatter and Jackie Wilson.\n\nBilly Ward (born Robert L. Williams, 19 September 1921, Savannah, Georgia—died 16 February 2002, Inglewood, California) grew up in Philadelphia, the second of three sons of Charles Williams and Cora Bates Williams, and was a child musical prodigy, winning an award for a piano composition at the age of 14. Following military service he studied music in Chicago, and at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. While working as a vocal coach and part-time arranger on Broadway, he met talent agent Rose Marks, who became his business and songwriting partner.\n\nThe pair set out to form a vocal group from the ranks of his students. The group was at first called the Ques, and comprised Clyde McPhatter (lead tenor), Charlie White (tenor), Joe Lamont (baritone), and Bill Brown (bass). Ward acted as their pianist and arranger. After the group made successful appearances on talent shows in the Apollo Theater and on the Arthur Godfrey show in 1950, Rene Hall recommended them to Ralph Bass of Federal Records, a subsidiary of King, where they were signed to a recording contract and renamed themselves the Dominoes. Their first single release, \"Do Something For Me\", with McPhatter’s lead vocal, reached the R&B charts in early 1951, climbing to #6.\n\nAfter a less successful follow-up, the group released \"Sixty Minute Man\", on which Brown sang lead, and boasted of being able to satisfy his girls with fifteen minutes each of \"kissin'\" \"teasin'\" and \"squeezin'\", before \"blowin'\" his \"top\". It reached #1 on the R&B chart in May 1951 and stayed there for a 14 weeks. It was an important record in several respects—it crossed the boundaries between gospel singing and blues, its lyrics pushed the limits of what was deemed acceptable, and it appealed to many white as well as black listeners, peaking at #17 on the pop charts. In later years, it became a contender for the title of \"the first rock and roll record\".\n\nThe group toured widely, building up a reputation as one of the top R&B acts of the era, and an audience which crossed racial divides. However, Ward's strict disciplinarian approach, and failure to recompense the singers, caused internal problems. The name \"The Dominoes\" was owned by Ward and Marks, who had the power to hire and fire, and to pay the singers a salary. Clyde McPhatter was being paid barely enough to live on, and often found himself billed as \"Clyde Ward\" to fool fans into thinking he was Billy Ward's brother. White and Brown both left in 1951 to form The Checkers, and were replaced by James Van Loan and David McNeil (previously of The Larks).\n\nIn March 1952, the Dominoes were chosen to be the only vocal group at Alan Freed's \"Moondog Coronation Ball\". The hits continued, with \"Have Mercy Baby\" topping the R&B charts for 10 weeks in 1952. However, in early 1953, McPhatter also decided to leave, and soon formed a new group, The Drifters. His replacement in the Dominoes was Jackie Wilson, who had sung with the group on tour. Lamont and McNeil also left and were replaced by Milton Merle and Cliff Givens. With Wilson singing lead, singles such as \"You Can't Keep A Good Man Down\" continued to be successful.\n\nIn 1954, Ward moved the group to the Jubilee label and then to Decca, where they enjoyed a #27 pop hit with \"St. Teresa of the Roses\". However, the group were unable to follow that success in the charts, and there were a succession of personnel changes. They increasingly moved away from their R&B roots with appearances in Las Vegas and elsewhere. In late 1956, Wilson left for a solo career and was replaced by Gene Mumford of The Larks. The group then got a new contract with Liberty Records, and had a #13 pop hit with \"Stardust\". This proved to be their last major success, although various line-ups of the group continued recording and performing into the 1960s.\n\nThey were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nFormer members \nBilly Ward\nClyde McPhatter\nCharlie White\nJoe Lamont\nBill Brown\nJames Van Loan\nDavid McNeil\nJackie Wilson\nMilton Merle\nCliff Givens  User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "The Jefferson Airplane": {
    "bio": "Jefferson Airplane was an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1965.

After 1972, Jefferson Airplane effectively split into two groups. Kaukonen and Casady moved on full-time to their own band, Hot Tuna. Slick, Kantner, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane recruited new members and regrouped as Jefferson Starship in 1974, with Balin eventually joining them.

  "The Judds": {
    "bio": "The Judds was an American country music duo of Naomi Judd (born Diana Ellen Judd on 11 January 1946; died 30 April 2022) and her daughter Wynonna Judd. The duo signed to RCA Nashville in 1983 and released six studio albums between then and 1991. One of the most successful acts in country music history, the duo won five Grammy Awards for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and nine Country Music Association awards. They also had 25 singles on the country music charts between 1983 and 2000, of which 14 went to No. 1. After eight successful years as a duo, The Judds ceased performing in 1991 after Naomi Judd was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Soon after, Wynonna Judd embarked on a highly successful solo career. The two occasionally reunited for special tours, notably in 2017 and performing \"Love Can Build a Bridge\" at the 2022 CMT music awards. In 2021, The Judds were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nWhen Naomi Judd found herself pregnant, she quickly got married but not to the father of her first child, daughter Christina Ciminella. Christina, born May 30, 1964, became known as Wynonna Judd when the mother-daughter duo stormed the country charts in the 1980s. \n\nAfter Naomi Judd divorced, she moved from Hollywood, back to Morrill, Ky., with Wynonna and another daughter Ashley. There, she worked as a nurse in a local infirmary. Outside working and school hours, she and the children would sing anything from bluegrass to showbiz standards for their own amusement. However, when Wynonna nurtured aspirations to be a professional entertainer, her mother lent her encouragement, to the extent of moving the family to Nashville in 1979. Naomi's contralto subtly underlined Wynonna's tuneful drawl.\n\nIn addition to many performances on Ralph Emery's morning television show, Naomi elicited an audition for RCA Records while tending a hospitalized relation of label producer Brent Maher. With a past that read like a Judith Krantz novel, the Judds -- so the executives considered -- would have more than an even chance in the country market. An exploratory mini-album, which contained proved the executives correct. The single \"Had a Dream (From the Heart)\" peaked at No. 17 in 1984. Later that year, the Judds scored their first of 14 No. 1 hits with \"Mama He's Crazy.\" \n\nSelf-composed songs included Naomi's 1989 composition \"Change of Heart,\" dedicated to her future second husband (and former Elvis Presley backing vocalist) Larry Strickland. Meanwhile, Maher co-wrote hits such as 1985's Grammy-winning \"Why Not Me,\" \"Turn It Loose,\" \"Girls Night Out,\" \"Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout The Good Ol' Days)\" and \"Rockin' With the Rhythm of the Rain.\"\n\nMost Judds records exhibited an acoustic bias and a penchant for star guests that included the Jordanaires on \"Don't Be Cruel,\" Emmylou Harris on \"The Sweetest Gift,\" Mark Knopfler on his \"Water of Love\" and Bonnie Raitt playing slide guitar on the album Love Can Build a Bridge. In 1988, the pair became the first female country act to found their own booking agency (Pro-Tours), but a chronic hepatitis infection forced Naomi to retire from the concert stage two years later.\n\nThe Judds toured America in a series of farewell concerts before Wynonna began her solo career. Wynonna got off to a strong start, as her first two singles both went to #1. Her 1994 single \"Girls With Guitars\" featured Naomi (as well as Lyle Lovett) on backup vocals. \n\nIn 1998, The Judds appeared in a commercial for the retail chain Kmart, singing Wynonna's single \"Woman To Woman\". \n\nIn 1999, Wynonna reunited with her mother for a New Year's Eve concert in Phoenix. The following year, the duo recorded four new tracks for a bonus disc issued with Wynonna's album New Day Dawning, and undertook a multi-city tour. The results were issued as the album Reunion Live. A 2004 single, \"Flies On The Butter (You Can't Go Home Again)\" was recorded with Naomi; however, the single was credited as \"Wynonna with Naomi Judd\" instead of \"The Judds\".

  "The Monkees": {
    "bio": "The Monkees was an American pop rock band formed in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. The band consisted of Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork. Spurred by the success of The Monkees television series, they were one of the most successful bands of the late 1960s. The band produced four chart-topping albums and three chart-topping songs (\"Last Train to Clarksville\", \"I'm a Believer\", and \"Daydream Believer\").\n\nThe Monkees was originally a fictional band created for the NBC television sitcom The Monkees. Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith and Tork were cast to portray members of a band in the sitcom. Music credited to the Monkees appeared in the sitcom and was released on LPs and singles beginning in 1966, and the sitcom aired from 1966 to 1968. At first, the band members' musical contributions were primarily limited to lead vocals and the occasional composition, with the remaining music provided by professional songwriters and studio musicians. Though this arrangement yielded multiple hit albums and singles, the band members desired greater control over the creation of their music. Following a brief power struggle, the Monkees gained full control over the recording process in 1967. For two albums, the Monkees mostly performed as a group; however, within a year, each member was pursuing his own interests under the Monkees' name, rendering the Monkees once again a group in name only. With widespread allegations that the band members did not play their own instruments—followed by the cancellation of The Monkees TV series, diminishing success on the charts, and waning popularity overall—band members began to leave the group. The Monkees held a final recording session in 1970 before breaking up.\n\nRenewed interest in the Monkees emerged in 1986, leading to a 20th anniversary reunion. Over the subsequent 35 years, the Monkees intermittently reunited for reunion tours, a major-network television special, and the production of new studio albums. After the deaths of Jones in 2012 and Tork in 2019, Dolenz and Nesmith undertook a farewell tour in 2021. This tour concluded shortly before Nesmith's death later that year, leaving Dolenz as the sole surviving member of the Monkees.\n\nMembers\n– Micky Dolenz – lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, drums, percussion, keyboards (1966–1971, 1976, 1986–1989, 1996–1997, 2001–2002, 2011–2021)\n\n– Davy Jones – lead and backing vocals, percussion, drums, rhythm guitar, bass (1966–1971, 1976, 1986–1989, 1996–1997, 2001–2002, 2011–2012; died 2012)\n\n– Michael Nesmith – lead and rhythm guitars, keyboards, backing and lead vocals (1966–1970, 1986, 1989, 1996–1997, 2012–2014, 2016, 2018–2021; died 2021)\n\n– Peter Tork – bass, rhythm and lead guitars, keyboards, banjo, backing and occasional lead vocals (1966–1968, 1976, 1986–1989, 1996–1997, 2001, 2011–2018; died 2019)\n\nThe Monkees (1966)\nMore of The Monkees (1967)\nHeadquarters (1967)\nPisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd.

  "The Neville Brothers": {
    "bio": "The Neville Brothers was an American R&B/soul/funk group, formed in 1977 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The group formally disbanded in 2012 but reunited in 2015 for a farewell concert in New Orleans.\n\nThe group notion started in 1976, when the four brothers of the Neville family, Art (1937-2019), Charles (1938–2018), Aaron (b. 1941), and Cyril (b. 1948) got together to take part in the recording session of The Wild Tchoupitoulas, a Mardi Gras Indian group led by the Nevilles' uncle, George Landry (\"Big Chief Jolly\").\n\nArt Neville reached out to Paul Howrilla (personal manager for Dr. John) and told him that he always wanted to do something with his brothers. Paul Howrilla created Neville Productions, Inc., serving as president and CEO with all four Neville brothers as members of the board of directors. The newly formed business covered the entire Neville family, designed to protect them from the music business abuse they had previously endured in their individual careers.\n\nThis experience led them to form the group the following year. Their debut album was released from Capitol Records in 1978.\n\nIn 1988, the group released Uptown from EMI featuring guests including Branford Marsalis, Keith Richards, and Carlos Santana. The following year saw the release of Yellow Moon from A&M Records produced by Daniel Lanois. The track \"Healing Chant\" from that album won best pop instrumental performance of the Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 1990, the Neville Brothers contributed \"In the Still of the Night\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Blue produced by the Red Hot Organization. Also in 1990, they appeared on the bill at that year's Glastonbury Festival. This also was the year they recorded \"Sons and Daughters\" on their Brother's Keeper album.\n\nTheir version of \"Bird on the Wire\" was played over the closing credits of the 1990 film, Bird on a Wire.\n\nDue to the health problems of Art Neville, the band kept a low profile in the late 1990s onto the early 2000s. They made a comeback in 2004, however, with the album, Walkin' In The Shadow Of Life, from Back Porch Records, their first newly recorded effort in five years.\n\nAll brothers except Charles, a Massachusetts resident, had been living in New Orleans, but following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 Cyril and Aaron moved out of the city. They had not been performing in New Orleans since Katrina hit the city, however, they finally returned to perform there at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2008, being given the closing spot which had been reserved for them for years.\n\nInfrequently, Ivan Neville, Aaron's son (keyboards) and Ian Neville, Art's son (electric guitar), both of the band Dumpstaphunk, have played with the band in recent years.\n\nThe group formally disbanded in 2012 but reunited in 2015 for a farewell concert in New Orleans. \n\nCharles Neville died of pancreatic cancer on April 26, 2018, at the age of 79.\n\nArt Neville died at age 81 on July 22, 2019, after years of declining health.

The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. The O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) had their first hit with \"Lonely Drifter\", in 1963. In spite of the record's success, the group was considering quitting the music business until Gamble & Huff, a legendary team of producers and songwriters, took an interest in the group. With Gamble & Huff, the O'Jays emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with Back Stabbers (1972), a huge pop hit, and topped the U.S. singles charts the following year with their anthemic \"Love Train\".\n\nThey formed the group in Canton, Ohio in 1958 while attending Canton McKinley High School. Originally known as The Triumphs, and then The Mascots, the friends began recording with \"Miracles\" in 1961, which was a moderate hit in the Cleveland area. In 1963 they took the name \"The O'Jays\", in tribute to radio disc jockey Eddie O'Jay (Toop, 1991), and released \"Lonely Drifter\", which charted nationally. Their debut LP was Comin' Through. Throughout the 1960s, they continued to chart with songs such as \"Lipstick Traces\" (which they performed nationally on the ABC Television program, Shivaree), \"Stand In For Love\", \"Let It All Out\", \"I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow\", \"Deeper In Love With You\" and \"One Night Affair\", along with several other regional and national Pop and R&B hits. In 1972, they finally scored with their first million-seller, \"Back Stabbers\", from the gold album of the same name. By this time, original member Bobby Massey had also departed, leaving the group a trio. This album produced several more hit singles, including \"992 Arguments\", \"Sunshine\", \"Time To Get Down\" and the #1 Pop smash, \"Love Train\". They became known as \"The Mighty O'Jays\" due to their exciting, emotion-packed stage performances, led by the dynamic Levert, and the cool, multi-range vocals of Walter Williams, coupled with the matinee idol looks and smooth first tenor voice of William Powell.\n\nDuring the remainder of the 1970s the O'Jays continued releasing chart-topping singles, including \"Put Your Hands Together\" (Pop #10), \"For the Love of Money\" (Pop #9), \"Give the People What They Want\", \"Let Me Make Love To You\", \"I Love Music\" (Pop #5), \"Livin' for the Weekend\", \"Message in Our Music\" and \"Darlin' Darlin' Baby (Sweet Tender Love)\". Original member William Powell died of cancer in 1977 at the age of just 35.\n\nAfter adding Sammy Strain (born December 9, 1941) (of Little Anthony & the Imperials), the O'Jays continued recording, though with limited success. 1978's \"Use ta Be My Girl\" was their final Top Five hit, though they continued placing songs on the R&B charts throughout the 1980s. Their 1987 album, Let Me Touch You, was a breakthrough of sorts, and included the #1 R&B hit \"Lovin' You\". Eddie Levert also got a copy of Kevan Tynes' \"Loving You\" prior to recording their version .Though they continued charting on the R&B charts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the O'Jays never again achieved pop success. In 1992, Sammy Strain left the group, and returned to the Imperials, to be replaced by Nathaniel Best, and later, by Eric Grant. Later in the 1990s, the group did little recording, though they remained a popular live draw. Their latest album was Imagination in 2004.\n\nIn 2003, they co-starred in the movie The Fighting Temptations, which starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyonce Knowles. In the film, they played three barbers who joined the local church choir to help out the film's protagonist Darrin (Gooding) who was the choir director.\n\nIn 2005 the O'Jays were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Original members Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Bobby Massey and, posthumously, William Powell, were inducted. In a note of controversy, 70's O'Jays member Sammy Strain was also inducted with the group, while original member Bill Isles was not. (Strain is one of the few artists in popular music history who is a double RRHOF inductee: with The O'Jays in 2005, and The Imperials in 2009). In 2006, the O'Jays performed at the ESPY awards, hosted by Lance Armstrong. \"For the Love of Money\" is the theme song to the hit reality TV show The Apprentice, starring Donald Trump, which is ironic considering that the lyrics warn of the evil people will do for the love of money.\n\nOn February 23, 2007, Radio-Canada's website reported that Canadian Industry Minister Jim Prentice had used the song \"For The Love of Money\" without the group's permission during a political event, a faux pas since Prentice is responsible for the application of the Copyright Act in Canada. Radio-Canada also reports that Prentice has since been contacted by the attorneys for both the O'Jays and Warner/Chappell Music.\n\nOn June 28, 2009, at the 2009 BET Award Show in the Shrine Auditorium the O'Jays were honored with BET's 2009 Life Time Achievement Award. Tevin Campbell, Trey Songz, Tyrese Gibson, and Johnny Gill performed a medley of the groups songs followed by the presentation of the award by Don Cornelius. The group reminisced, joked with the audience and accepted their award before performing a rendition of their hit songs.

  "The Paris Sisters": {
    "bio": "The Paris Sisters were Albeth, Priscilla, and Sherrell Paris, a soft-voiced sister trio from San Francisco, California. The group was formed in the early '50s due to the aspirations of their opera singing mother. Mrs. Paris had quit a career at San Francisco Milano Opera Company to raise the three girls as singers, training them around the family piano. When another earlier vintage trio The Andrew Sisters came to San Francisco to perform, Mom had the girls all dressed alike and sitting in front, mouthing the words to their songs for the full three weeks of their engagement.\n\nUnable to not notice, The Andrew Sisters put the girls on stage to perform. The three pre-teen sisters preceded to wow the audience with their version of the Andrew Sisters' \"Rum and Coca Cola.\" An MCA Records agent was in the audience and soon had them on the road playing USO shows and fairs along the California coast.\n\nIn 1954-'55 they recorded pop singles like \"Ooh La La\" and \"Huckleberry Pie\" for Decca. Soon thereafter, The Paris Sisters found themselves in Las Vegas working as a lounge act from midnight to seven in the morning at the ages of nine (Priscilla), ten (Albeth), and fifteen (Sherrell). Wigs, padded bras and hips, lots of make up, and false eyelashes hid their youth and their dad's ability to revise their birth certificates, since he worked at the hospital where they were born. They sang at the Dunes with Frank Sinatra and the Frontier with a young Elvis Presley.\n\nIn 1957, they recorded \"Old Enough To Cry\" for Imperial Records. So far, none of their records had sold many copies. But they were talented and professional despite their age, so they made some money from '58-'59 singing on demos at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nBy 1959, the sisters had met Jess Rand who brought them to Imperial Records where they recorded two singles that went unnoticed. In 1961 Lester Sill saw the sisters and acquired their contract from Rand. Sill then brought a young Phil Spector from New York to produce the girls. Though the Paris Sisters had always sung three-part-harmony and rarely featured a lead, Spector saw a similarity between Priscilla's voice and Annette Kleinbard of the Teddy Bears. Spector envisioned a new Teddy Bear Style.\n\nSpector brought the group to New York and had them stay at his New York apartment while he moved across the street to the Park Plaza. In typical Spector fashion he woke them in the wee hours and took them through Central Park in a horse drawn carriage to rehearse songs.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, they recorded \"Be My Boy\" which Sill took to various record companies with none wanting to pick it up. Sill then issued it on his newly formed Gregmark label and by April 24th it had charted, reaching #56 on the Billboard Top 100.\n\nSill then went to New York looking for a follow up song and found it at Don Kirshner's Aldon Music. It was a Barry Mann and Larry Kolber ballad entitled \"I Love How You Love Me.\" The song became the Paris Sisters' second Gregmark release and a precursor to the Spector's yet to be developed \"wall of sound.\" With Priscilla on lead and the girl's hypnotic harmony, \"I Love How You Love Me\" rose to number five on October 30.\n\nThe next record  \"He Knows I Love Him Too Much\" was written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King and eventually rose to number thirty-four. At this time the group recorded a Spector-produced album of similar songs that mysteriously disappeared. Without an album to follow the hits the Paris Sisters found them effectively back at square one. They did some backup sessions and a disagreement over royalties due them, soon found them label-less.\n\nThey appeared in a British rock and roll movie produced by Richard Lester (who later did the Beatles films) titled Ring-A-Ding Rhythm and toured the U.S. with Dion and the Belmonts and the Marvelettes , among others. In 1964, the Paris Sisters recorded a rock-a-ballad version of Bobby Darin's \"Dream Lover\" that peaked at number ninety-one.\n\nThree albums and five singles in 1966 and 1967 failed, and by the early 70s the group disbanded. Sherrell formed a band called Sherrell Paris and the New People that toured until the late 70s. Sherrell remarried for the second time and became an executive assistant on Bob Barker's TV show, The Price Is Right. Albeth went into independent TV production with her husband.\n\nPriscilla Paris released three solo albums between 1967 and 1978, during which she moved to England and then Paris. In 1978 an accident left her with partial facial paralysis. Tragedy struck again on March 5, 2004, when she died following a fall at home. Her sweet, whispery vocals were a pure aural delight, inspiring Phil Spector to some of his greatest early heights as a ground-breaking young producer. \"She had a unique sound, and she sang with so much passion and so much from her heart,\" says Albeth. \"I think her sound will never be forgotten.\" User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "The Pointer Sisters": {
    "bio": "The Pointer Sisters is an American  vocal group originally of four sisters out of the West Oakland Church of God where their father was a preacher. Under management & production of David Rubinson & later Richard Perry, the sisters became a hugely successful act throughout the '70s & '80s, creating a two-and-a-half decades long career. Amongst the many hit tracks included \"Jump (For My Love)\", \"He's So Shy\", \"Happiness\", \"Fairytale\" and \"Neutron Dance\". They had many record labels starting with their first failed single on Atlantic on through to long periods with Blue Thumb, Planet, RCA, and later Motown and even SBK.\n\nBonnie Pointer and June Pointer first formed a secular singing duo in the late '60s and began performing in clubs around the San Francisco Bay area; Anita Pointer and Ruth Pointer later joined them. The Pointer Sisters hooked up with David Rubinson who was a record producer affiliated with Bill Graham. They would perform onstage with the flamboyant Sylvester of The Cockettes, and they'd done some work as background singers on recordings by Elvin Bishop, Boz Scaggs, Cold Blood and other San Francisco Bay Area groups.\n\nTheir big breakthrough was a cover of an Allen Toussaint composition originally recorded in 1970 by Lee Dorsey, the song was \"Yes We Can Can\" released by The Pointer Sisters in March 1973. The girls' voices were added over funky backing tracks laid down with the help of Rubinson's contacts like Tower of Power guitarist Willie Fulton. They sang live around a single mic, with Anita handling lead, and upon release the record soon hit Number 11 on Billboard's pop chart and Number 12 on the R&B chart. In 1974 the group surprised white audiences when they broke the color barrier in at The Grand Ol' Opry when performing their Country Grammy award winning country song \"Fairytale\" in Nashville. \"How Long (Betcha Got A Chick On The Side)\" was a 1975 #1 R&B hit from their Steppin LP, with classic funky keys of Herbie Hancock on clavinet & wicked guitar stylings of Wah Wah Watson...\n\nBonnie Pointer left the group in 1977 for a solo career, and in 1978, the remaining sisters switched labels to Planet & production duties went to Richard Perry who modernized their sound away from a nostalgia based act into a more contemporary look & sound for the 1980's.\n\nThey produced the album Energy, with a classic country flavored updates of Sly Stone's \"Everybody Is A Star\", and a rendition of another Allen Toussaint song called \"Happiness\". The Perry streak included 1984's Break Out, which did exactly that going triple platinum and winning two Grammys for the singles Automatic and \"Jump (for My Love)\". This period in the early 80's ostensibly represents the group's commercial peak as a charting act. Their last big hit was Neutron Dance from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack. \n\nAs the '80s wound down, June Pointer recorded two solo albums, and later left the trio by 2001. Anita also did some solo project work, and had a minor hit with a song called, \"Overnight Success.\"\n\nAnita and Ruth still perform concerts under the group's name. Ruth's daughter, Issa Pointer, is the trio's newest member. June suffered a stroke on February 27, 2006. While hospitalized, she was diagnosed with cancer, which had metastasized in her breast, colon, liver and bones. She died at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California on April 11, 2006 at the age of 52.

  "The Revivalists": {
    "bio": "The Revivalists is an American rock band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2007. The 7-piece band consists of Ed Williams (pedal steel guitar, guitar), David Shaw (lead vocals), Zack Feinberg (guitar), Rob Ingraham (saxophone), George Gekas (bass guitar), Andrew Campanelli (drums, percussion), and Michael Girardot (keyboards, trumpet). The group's sound has been described as \"a Crescent City-rhythm spin on jam-band jubilee.\"\n\nSince forming in 2007, the band's combination of danceable rock and soulful songwriting (and brilliantivity) has come to life through a meticulously-crafted and ever-evolving live performance. The band has been instrumental in the growth of New Orleans’ burgeoning indie rock scene, and they have achieved success and notoriety in the city’s competitive musical landscape.\n\nThe Revivalists have proven themselves as a live act.  They have managed to advance from low-profile local gigs to extensive touring, developing a loyal fan base at home and across the Gulf Coast Region and gaining footholds nationally. Abroad, they have commanded such venues as The Kennedy Center (Washington, DC), Sullivan Hall (New York City), Toad’s Place (New Haven, CT), and Smith’s Olde Bar (Atlanta, GA). At home, The Revivalists are regulars at The Howlin’ Wolf, The Republic, and the legendary Tipitina’s. They have shared stages with such notable acts as Perpetual Groove, Marco Benevento, Rebirth Brass Band, Ivan Neville’s Dumpstaphunk, The Lee Boys and Snarky Puppy. Additionally, they have established themselves as an engaging festival act, winning over audiences at French Quarter Fest, Crawfest and Foburg Festival in New Orleans, Hamstock Barbecue and Music Festival in Ridgeland, MS, and The Duke Ellington Jazz Festival in Washington, DC. Most recently, The Revivalists played the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. There, they caught the attention of Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke, who wrote about their performance on his blog on rollingstone.com.\n\nThe Revivalists have also grown as studio musicians. Their first release was listed as an editor’s pick in both the Jam and American Traditional Rock categories on CDBaby.com, despite being a humble five-song EP. Their second release, Vital Signs, is both the band’s first full-length album and a significant step forward in terms of production and scale. The young band was privileged to record under the guidance of Grammy Award-winning producer Chris Finney, whose resumé ranges from Dr. John to R.E.M. Vital Signs is the result of this collaboration. Soon after its release, Vital Signs became the top-selling album on CDBaby in the American Traditional Rock category, and was quickly selected to be featured in their newsletter. \n\nMembers:\nGeorge Gekas (bass)\nAndrew Campanelli (drums)\nZack Feinberg (guitar)\nDavid Shaw (vocals, guitar)\nEd “Steel” Williams (pedal steel guitar)\nRob Ingraham (saxophone, miscellaneous/other) User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "The Rolling Stones": {
    "bio": "The Rolling Stones is an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, got them gigs, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" (1965), \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (1965), and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international number-one hits. Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by The Daily Telegraph to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"/\"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.\n\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\". Sticky Fingers (1971), which yielded \"Brown Sugar\" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. Exile on Main St. (1972), featuring \"Tumbling Dice\", and Goats Head Soup (1973), yielding the hit ballad \"Angie\", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ron Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: Some Girls (1978), featuring \"Miss You\", and Tattoo You (1981), featuring \"Start Me Up\". Steel Wheels (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by Voodoo Lounge (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, Blue & Lonesome, became their twelfth UK number-one album.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Billboard magazine and Rolling Stone have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones\n\nStudio albums\nThe Rolling Stones / England's Newest Hit Makers (1964)\n12 X 5 (1964)\nThe Rolling Stones No. 2 / The Rolling Stones, Now!

    "bioSummary": "The Rolling Stones is an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts.

  "The Ronettes": {
    "bio": "The Ronettes was a girl group of the 1960s from New York City, best known for their work with producer Phil Spector. They consisted of lead singer Veronica Bennett (a.k.a. Ronnie Spector), her sister Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. Their defining album is \"Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica\" from 1963, and their most famous songs include \"Be My Baby\", \"Baby, I Love You\", \"(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up\", and \"Walking in the Rain\".\n\nThe group's career:\nSisters Estelle (born 1941) and Veronica Bennett (born 1943), and their cousin Nedra Talley (born 1946), began singing together as teenagers in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Encouraged by their grandmother, they entered and won a talent show at the Apollo Theatre in 1959, as The Darling Sisters. Phillip Halikus saw their potential, became their manager, and promoted their early appearances at hops and charity shows.\n\nIn 1961, while standing in line at the Peppermint Lounge, they were mistaken for a singing trio that had not arrived and were ushered on stage. After performing Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\", they were signed to appear regularly there and in Miami. Later that year, they danced in shows staged by disc jockey Murray the K, but, contrary to many sources, did not appear in the 1961 film Twist Around the Clock. They did get a record deal with the Colpix label, and, as Ronnie & the Relatives, released their first single \"I Want a Boy\". They also worked as backing singers for Bobby Rydell, Del Shannon, and Joey Dee & The Starliters. Renamed as The Ronettes, they issued several more singles with Colpix and recorded an album, unissued at the time, but had little early commercial success.\n\nIn 1963 they came to the attention of producer Phil Spector, who was looking for a new girl group to assume The Crystals' mantle. He was taken with Ronnie's voice and style, and signed The Ronettes to his Philles label. As Spector's new protégées, they were given a strong image as \"bad girls\", with beehive hairdos, heavy eyeliner, and tight skirts. Their first Philles single was \"Be My Baby\", co-written by Spector with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, and arranged and produced by Spector. It became a worldwide hit, reaching # 2 on the U.S. pop chart, # 4 on the R&B chart, and # 4 on the UK chart. The follow-up, \"Baby, I Love You\", had an even denser arrangement, featuring Leon Russell on piano, and backing vocals from Darlene Love and Cher, among others. It was slightly less successful, reaching # 24 in the United States and # 11 in the United Kingdom. The Ronettes also featured on Spector's album \"A Christmas Gift for You\".\n\nEarly in 1964 The Ronettes toured England with The Rolling Stones and met The Beatles. They continued to have hits with \"(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up\" (# 39 U.S., # 43 UK), \"Do I Love You?\" (# 34 U.S., # 35 UK), and \"Walking in the Rain\" (# 24 U.S.), which won a Grammy for Best Sound Effects, the only one Spector ever received. However, their LP, \"Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica\", only reached # 96 and other singles were less successful; musical tastes had moved beyond the girl group sound, and the Ronettes were unable to maintain their relevance. After criss-crossing the United States and Canada as one of the opening acts for the final concert tour of The Beatles, they disbanded at the end of 1966.\n\n\nLater events:\nEstelle Bennett and Nedra Talley each married and, in 1968, Ronnie Bennett married Phil Spector and retired from performance for several years. In 1971, under Spector's direction, Ronnie recorded \"Try Some, Buy Some\" for the Beatles' Apple label. This was her last charting record, reaching # 77 in the spring of 1971.\n\nIn 1973, as she and Spector were about to divorce, she returned to performing at Richard Nader's \"Rock and Roll Revival\" show at Madison Square Garden. Her new version of The Ronettes at that time included Denise Edwards and Chip Fields, and they issued two singles on the Buddah label.\n\nIn 1988, the original Ronettes sued Spector for nonpayment of royalties. In 2001, a New York court announced a verdict in favor of the Ronettes, ordering Spector to pay nearly three million dollars in back royalties; however, the judgment was later overturned on appeal. On February 11, 2009 Estelle Bennett was found dead at her home in Englewood, New Jersey. She was 67.\n\nAwards and recognition:\nThe Ronettes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nIt was believed that Phil Spector, in his capacity as a member of the Board of Governors, deliberately prevented the Ronettes (and Darlene Love) from being nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although they had been eligible for a considerable period. The alleged reasons included the acrimonious divorce of Ronnie and Spector, in addition to the group having (unsuccessfully) sued Spector for back royalties. While Spector was awaiting trial on a murder charge and out on $1 million bail, the Ronettes were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the March 12, 2007, induction ceremony held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Keith Richards, a self-confessed longtime fan, inducted the trio. Ronnie Bennett (Spector) and Nedra Talley performed \"Baby, I Love You,\" \"Walking In the Rain\" and \"Be My Baby.\" Estelle Bennett was present to accept her award but did not perform.

  "The Shirelles": {
    "bio": "The Shirelles were an influential American girl group in the early 1960s, and they were the very first girl group to have a number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The members of the quartet were Shirley Owens (who was the lead singer for the most part), Doris Coley, Beverly Lee, and Addie \"Micki\" Harris. The quartet formed in New Jersey in 1958, and went on to release a string of hits including \"Baby It's You\", \"Mama Said\", and the #1 Pop hits \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" and \"Soldier Boy\". Their \"Sha La La\" became an international hit when covered by the British group Manfred Mann, and \"Boys\" was covered by [artsit]the Beatles (Ringo Starr singing lead).The Beatles also covered \"Baby It's You\" on their \"Please Please Me\" album. Although they had no more charting hits after 1967, the Shirelles continued recording for a small but devoted audience well into the 1970s and continued to tour and perform into the early 1980s. In 1968, Coley left the group to remarry and raise her family, and the group continued as a trio. In 1975, she returned only to replace Owens who departed to begin a solo career. On June 10, 1982, after a live concert in Atlanta, Harris succumbed to a heart attack (age 42); she was replaced by Louie Bethune. Shortly, the group went into semi-retirement, though they did accept an invitation to record backup vocals for Dionne Warwick in the late 1980s. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. On February 4, 2000, Coley lost a battle with breast cancer (age 58). The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

  "The Staples Singers": {
    "bio": "The Staple Singers was an American gospel, soul, and R&B singing group from Chicago who signed their first professional contract in 1952. Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples (1914–2000), the patriarch of the family, formed the group with his children Cleotha (1934–2013), Pervis (1935-2021), Yvonne (1937-2018), and Mavis (b. 1939). They are best-remembered for their 1970s hits \"Respect Yourself\", \"I'll Take You There\", \"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\", and \"Let's Do It Again\". In 1999 the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005 the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThe family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. They signed with United Records, then Vee-Jay, Riverside, Epic and, eventually, the black-owned indie Stax Records label where they hit their most fertile commercial peak.\n\nIn 1967, on Columbia subsidiary Epic, the Staple Singers first began moving into mainstream pop markets with \"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\" and \"For What It's Worth\" (written by Stephen Stills). In 1968, the Staple Singers signed to Stax and released two albums recorded with Steve Cropper of Booker T & the MG's fame - Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970, Al Bell had become producer, and the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals studio, moving in a more funk and soul direction. The first Stax hit was \"Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)\". In 1972, the group had a No. 1 hit in the United States with \"I'll Take You There.\" Their 1972 recording on Stax of  \"Respect Yourself,\" written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice, was number 2 on the R&B charts and a Top 40 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. During this Stax period they appeared at a 1972 summer concert at the LA Memorial Coliseum attended by 100,000 people and documented in the 1973 film and soundtrack album Wattstax.\n\nThe Staple Singers then signed to Curtom, Curtis Mayfield's imprint, and released the soundtrack to a comedy film co-starring Bill Cosby  called  \"Let's Do It Again\". The soundtrack was produced by Mayfield; and the title song was a huge hit in 1975. After this, however, they were not able to regain their commercial momentum, releasing occasional minor hits, and moving from label to label including Warner Brothers and  20th Century before returning to Epic in the mid 80s. Lead singer Mavis Staples began a fruitful solo career in earnest that continues to this day and involves live performing with her sister Yvonne Staples. The other daughters in the group who did not pursue solo careers were Pervis Staples, and Cleotha Staples.\n\nIn 1994, the family made this final recording of a duet with Mary Stuart (reprising their Last Watz style backing on a cover of  \"The Weight\" by The Band), somewhat re-establishing an audience. \n\nPops Staples died in December 2000. \n\nCleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21, 2013.\n\nYvonne Staples died in April 2018 and Pervis Staples in May 2021.

The Temptations is an American Motown singing group whose repertoire has included doo-wop, soul, psychedelia, funk, disco, rnb, and adult contemporary. Formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1960 as The Elgins. The group, known for its finely tuned choreography, distinct harmonies, and stylish suits, has been said to be as influential to soul as The Beatles are to rock. Having sold an estimated 22 million albums by 1982, The Temptations are one of the most successful groups in black music history and were the definitive male vocal group of the 1960s. In addition, they have the second-longest tenure on Motown (behind Stevie Wonder), as they were with the label for a total of 40 years: 16 years from 1961 to 1977, and 24 more from 1980 to 2004 (from 1977 to 1980, they were signed to Atlantic Records). As of 2005, The Temptations continue to perform for Universal Records with only one original member, founder Otis Williams, in its lineup.\n\nLike its sister group The Supremes, The Temptations' lineup has changed frequently over the years. The original group included members of two local Detroit vocal groups: second tenor/baritone Otis Williams, first tenor Elbridge Bryant and bass Melvin Franklin from The Distants; and first tenor/falsetto Eddie Kendricks and second tenor/baritone Paul Williams (no relation to Otis) from The Primes. Among the most notable future Temptations were lead singers David Ruffin and Dennis Edwards (both of whom became successful Motown solo artists after leaving the group, as did Kendricks), Richard Street (another former Distant), Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, Ali-Ollie Woodson, Theo Peoples, and G.C. Cameron.\n\nOver the course of their career, The Temptations have released four number-one pop hit singles and 14 number-one R&B hit singles, and their material has earned them three Grammy Awards. Most of the early Temptations hits, including \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\", \"My Girl\", and \"Get Ready\" were written and produced by Smokey Robinson and other members of The Miracles, while composer/producer Norman Whitfield and lyricists Eddie Holland and Barrett Strong crafted most of the group's later hits, including \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", \"I Wish It Would Rain\", \"Cloud Nine\", \"I Can't Get Next to You\", \"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\", and \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\".\n\n2. There was also a 50s doo-wop group from New York named the Temptations. They are best remembered for their 1960 top 40 hit \"Barbara. After this hit, lead singer Neil Stevens went solo.

  "The Turtles": {
    "bio": "The Turtles was an American pop/rock band led by vocalists Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, a duo later known as Flo & Eddie. The band became notable for several Top 40 hits in the 60s, beginning with their version of Bob Dylan's \"It Ain't Me Babe\" in 1965. The band scored their biggest and best-known hit in 1967 with the song \"Happy Together\". Formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965, the band was renowned for their both joyously melancholic and occasionally cheeky sound, always being good-natured.\n\nOriginated from a surf rock group called the Crossfires, the Turtles delved into many genres such as breezy pop, psychedelic music, and folk rock. A precursor to the bubblegum pop of the late 60s and early 70s as well as a foil to the more self-consciously hip and \"serious\" acts of the era, the Turtles produced at least a dozen memorable, radio-friendly chart singles. Yet they remain best known for 1967's \"Happy Together\", which was their only chart-topping single.\n\nThe Turtles wound down their career in 1970.\n \nThe two prominent singers -  Howard Kaylan (\"Eddie\") and Mark Volman (\"Flo\" a.k.a. \"Phlorescent Leech\") - collaborated with Frank Zappa for a short but very intensive period of one and a half years (between 1970-72) and were the cornerstone of what was known to be the Zappa \"Vaudeville\" band; two of the most famous achievements of that period being the albums Fillmore East – June 1971 and 200 Motels, the soundtrack of the film by the same name.

  "The Who": {
    "bio": "The Who is an English rock band formed in Acton, Middlesex in 1964. Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work.\n\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\", reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including \"My Generation\", \"Substitute\" and \"Happy Jack\". In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single \"I Can See for Miles\", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera Tommy, included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's Who's Next, which included the hit \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\n\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–1997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.\n\nThe Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large PA systems, use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by hard rock, punk rock and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure. \n\nThe Who is one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts and they have been credited with originating the \"rock opera\". The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide.\n\nThe group's contributions to rock include the power chord, windmill strum and the use of non-musical instrument noise such as feedback. The band influenced fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art and the use of the Union Jack for clothing. The guitar-smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of Rolling Stone magazine's \"50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll\".\n\nPink Floyd began to use feedback from their early shows in 1966, inspired by the Who, whom they considered a formative influence. Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Jimi Hendrix visited Marshall's music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend's and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said the Who \"are the most exciting thing around\" and was inspired to write \"Helter Skelter\" in the group's \"heavy\" style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in \"Pinball Wizard\" for \"Polythene Pam\".\n\nThe loud volume of the band's live show influenced the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco.\n\nThe Who has inspired many tribute bands; Daltrey has endorsed the Whodlums, who raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Many bands have covered Who songs; Elton John's version of \"Pinball Wizard\" reached No. 7 in the UK.

  "Tom Jones": {
    "bio": "Sir Thomas Jones Woodward, KBE (born 7 June 1940), best known by his stage name, Tom Jones, is a Welsh pop singer particularly noted for his powerful voice. He was born in Treforest, near Pontypridd in South Wales.\n\nHe rose to fame in the mid-1960s, with an exuberant live act which included wearing tight breeches and billowing shirts, in an Edwardian style popular amongst his peers at the time. He was known for his overt sexuality, before this was as common as it became in subsequent years.\n\nIn 1963 he became the frontman for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a local beat group. Clad all in black leather, Tom soon gained a reputation in the South Wales area. The Senators were still all unheard of in London.\n\nIn 1964 they laid down a few tracks with maverick Telstar producer Joe Meek, and took them to various labels in an attempt to get a record deal. The plan was to release a single, Lonely Joe / I Was A Fool, but the ever-flighty Meek refused to release the tapes. The group returned to South Wales and continued to play gigs at dance halls and working mens clubs. One night, at the Top Hat in Cwmtillery, Tom was spotted by Gordon Mills, a London-based manager originally from South Wales. Mills became Tom's manager, and took the young singer to London. He also renamed him Tom Jones. The Senators became the Playboys, and later still the Squires.\n\nJones was awarded the Grammy Award for Best New Artist for 1965. It's Not Unusual, after the song having first been offered to Sandie Shaw. Jones recorded what was intended to be a demo for Shaw, but when she heard it she was so impressed with Jones' delivery that she declined the song and recommended that Jones release it himself. The record was the second Decca single Jones released, reaching number one in the UK charts in 1965. It was also the first hit for Jones in the US, peaking at #10 in May of that year. The single was released in the US on the Parrot label and also reached #3 on Billboard's easy listening chart. Jones used this song as the theme for his late 1960s-early 1970s musical variety series This Is Tom Jones. It has since become Jones' signature song.\n\nIn 1965 Tom sang the theme tune to the James Bond film Thunderball.\n\nJones' recording career slumped on the pop charts during the 1970s and 80s, although he placed 16 singles on the Billboard Country Music charts between 1976 and 1985, the biggest of which was \"Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow\" (# 1 Country, # 15 pop) in 1977, and his touring continued successfully. When his son Mark became his manager in 1987, his musical style was taken in a different direction. His recording career was revived with his first major hit single in over a decade, \"A Boy From Nowhere\", taken from the musical Matador. In 1988 he collaborated with The Art of Noise to record Prince's popular song \"Kiss\". Following this, he started to record in collaboration with a younger generation of musicians\n\nHis Reload album, released in 2000, became the biggest hit of his career. An album of cover versions recorded as duets with contemporary artists, using their record producers, and utilising their recording methods, it reached number one in the United Kingdom, and sold over 4 million copies worldwide.[1] In 2002, he released the album Mr. Jones, which was produced by Wyclef Jean and included the singles \"Tom Jones International\" and \"Black Betty\". In 2003, he was honored with a BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2004, his \"Sex Bomb\" single became a major club hit.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2000 President Bill Clinton invited Tom to perform at the Millennium Celebrations in Washington. Throughout 2000, Tom garnered several honours for his work, including a Brit Award for Best Male. In 2001 Tom toured throughout the Middle East and Europe. In subsequent years Tom recorded albums in collaboration with such artists as Wyclef Jean and Jools Holland.\n\nIn celebration of his 65th birthday, on 28 May 2005 Tom returned to his homeland to perform a spectacular concert in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd. This was Tom's first performance in Ponty since 1964.\n\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Tom Jones has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6608 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nIn 2005 the album Together In Concert, was recorded live with John Farnham and his band.\n\nHe has collaborated with Chicane for \"Stoned in Love\", a dance track that was released 24 April 2006. It entered at number eight in the UK charts the following Sunday.\n\nIn 2007, he signed to New York-based independent label S-Curve, owned by music executive Steve Greenberg. \n\nThe singer was awarded an OBE in 1999 and a Knight Bachelor in the 2006 New Years Honours list for his services to music and was subsequently knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, London on 29 March 2006.[7]\n\nOn 1 July 2007, Jones was one of the invited artists who performed at Wembley Stadium at the Concert for Diana, joined on stage by guitarist Joe Perry of Aerosmith and British soul singer Joss Stone. He sang the British National Anthem before Ricky Hatton's fight against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on 8 December 2007. On 19 April 2008 he sang the Welsh National Anthem at the Calzaghe-Hopkins fight in Las Vegas.\n\nAlthough his manager and public relations staff have attempted to change his sex-bomb image and neutralize the knicker-throwing fans, to the delight of his audiences Jones has never felt the need to tone down his behavior in the shows. Tom Jones has remained highly respected by other singers and continues to attract audiences of all ages. As of 2008, Jones continues to tour and record. A major portion of the year he regularly performs his show at the MGM Grand hotel, located on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, USA. His show at the MGM is performed in a cabaret-style theater. Other venues on his yearly schedule include numerous shows at Atlantic City, NJ and appearances in the USA, United Kingdom and Canada. In February 2007, Jones made a long-awaited South American tour.  \n\nOn 17 September 2008, Jones announced the release of his retro-tinged album \"24 Hours\" on S-Curve Records, his first for 15 years in the US; notably, this is the first record in which he's had a direct song-writing input. It was produced largely by drum'n'bass stalwarts Future Cut. \n\n\"It's all very well just singing songs,\" says Jones, \"but for this record I really wanted to get properly personal. I've been getting reflective recently, looking over my journey through life, and I wanted to get that down on song. This time I wanted to make something that was all about me, my stories, my life. In other words, you listen to this album and you get the real me.\" \n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers": {
    "bio": "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was a rock band formed in 1976 from Gainesville, Florida, USA and led by Tom Petty.\n\nPetty was supported by his band, The Heartbreakers, for the majority of his career. He has occasionally released solo work, as was the case with his 2006 album Highway Companion on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation himself. However, members of The Heartbreakers have played on each of his solo albums and the band has always backed him when touring in support of those albums.\n\nAfter the Petty's previous band Mudcrutch disbanded, Petty, never one to give up, enlisted Mudcrutch members Tench (keyboards) and Mike Campbell (guitar), along with Gainesville musicians Ron Blair (bass) and Stan Lynch (drums) to form the now famous lineup that was dubbed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. They released their first album, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in November 1976. In 2006, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of that release.\n\nThis lineup stayed intact for four records and was responsible for some of the most infectious songs (\"American Girl\", \"Breakdown\", \"Listen To Her Heart\", \"Refugee\", \"I Need To Know\", \"Don't Do Me Like That\") and one of the most critically acclaimed albums (\"Damn the Torpedoes\") of all time. Their tremendous success catapulted them from club band to arena rockers seemingly overnight.\n\nBassist Blair split the band in 1982 and was replaced by Howie Epstein, a protege of seminal rocker Del Shannon. Epstein's solid playing and soaring backing vocals further complemented the band's live attack. Without missing a beat, they headed back into the studio to record a string of successful albums, including the classic \"Long After Dark\". In 1994, Stan Lynch left the Heartbreakers to pursue other musical challenges and Steve Ferrone (well regarded for his work with the Average White Band and Eric Clapton) soon became the Heartbreakers' chosen drummer.\n\nMost recently, at a time when many of their contemporaries have long since grown complacent, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have in 2002 released one of their finest and most controversial efforts - featuring some of Petty's most moving songs. Recorded both before and following the group's 2002 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, \"The Last DJ\", reflected Petty's strong views about the state of the music business and the culture generally. With the departure of Howie Epstein, \"The Last DJ\" marked another notable return: after two decades away, founding Heartbreaker Ron Blair returned to the band's rhythm section.  In 2010, The Heartbreakers released the well received album \"Mojo\". \n\nPetty died on 2 October 2017 following a cardiac episode earlier that day at his home in Malibu, California. Although some media outlets incorrectly reported his death following an erroneous police report, his death was confirmed later that day by his publicist and manager.

  "Tom Waits": {
    "bio": "Tom Waits (born Thomas Alan Waits, in Pomona, California, on December 7, 1949) is a prolific American singer, songwriter, composer, and actor.\n\nHe started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit 'n' sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and poets like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski.  Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle\n\nWaits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and Americana, blues, and Vaudeville styles were not popular.  Waits's voice back then was soft, warm and clear. \n\nWaits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen and Rod Stewart. \n\nAlthough Waits’s albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries.\n\nLyrically, Waits's songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire.  \n\nWhile opening for Frank Zappa, the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa's avantgarde style. \n\nCountless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many  all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice.\n\nHis more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on Small Change. This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding \"like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car\". Small Change with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s. \n\nWaits subsequently developed a more unique style. His songs have grown more abrasive since then, and the arrangements have turned more surreal and experimental with every new record.  His life brings him to new visions, as indicated by the direction taken in his \"Alice\" release.\n\nWhile composing the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's One From The Heart Waits met Kathleen Brennan, his bride-to-be. They married in 1980 and she helped him quit drinking and smoking.  Since their marriage they have been working together on his albums as co-producers and co-writers. It is hard to say which part belongs to her and which to him, but it's easy to see that they make a perfect team.  Additionally, his eldest son Casey can be heard on turntables and percussion on Waits's album \"Real Gone\".\n\nOne of Waits's greatest successes was the album \"Swordfishtrombones\", released in 1983. It struck with his critics and fans alike. He achieved a new level of song writing and left former conventions (and his earlier career) behind. All songs, whether ballads, jive or jazz are played in a completely different way. It seems that Waits had taken the musical archetypes of these styles and made them his own. All tracks are in the quintessential Waits style. They have a striking rawness and listenability and they set the stage for his success and his future career. \n\nThe Bad As Me Songfacts reports that 36 years after the release of Waits' first album, Closing Time in 1973, Bad As Me became Waits's first ever top 10 album in the US when it debuted at #6 with 63,000 sales. \n\nIn the late 1980s Waits discovered an outlet for his creativity in composing musicals. His first Musical was named \"The Black Rider\", and is based on \"Der Freischütz\" by Carl Maria von Weber. It was co-produced by Robert Wilson and the lyrics come from William S. Burroughs. The story is slightly reminiscent of Kurt Weil's and Berthold Brecht's \"Three Penny Opera\" and the 1930s. The debut performance of the play was in 1990 at the Thalia Theater, Hamburg and has been played by various theatre groups since then.\n\nWaits was also responsible for two other musicals, which later became albums released simultaneously in 2002. One was the musical \"Blood Money,\" which covers the \"Woyczek\" theme of Georg Büchner. This one is one of the darkest works from Waits. The other musical is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". \"Alice\" is very romantic, dreamy and soft, and contains one of Waits most romantic songs. Even though they were released at the same time, the bootlegs of the \"Alice\" musical were long before traded between fans and were just rearranged and re-mastered for the official release.\n\nBesides many film contributions as composer – the Internet Movie Database imdb.com lists 47 appearances of Waits as composer and 38 soundtracks containing songs by Waits - he also is an actor with a total of 25 appearances, ranging from some mini-roles as a trumpeter in \"Heart of Saturday Night\" and the R. M. Renfield in \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" to the major role of Zack in Jim Jarmusch's \"Down by Law\". He recently appeared in Roberto Benigni's \"The Tiger and the Snow\", playing You Can Never Hold Back Spring at Benigni's wedding dream.  Even more recently, Waits played Mr.Nick (the Devil) in Terry Gilliam's \"The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus\".\n\nIn addition to a number of concert videos, he also appeared in the critically-acclaimed concert feature film \"Big Time\" (1990).\n\nWaits has always refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials. He has filed several lawsuits against advertisers for using his material without permission. Waits also successfully sued an advertiser for using a work that was stylistically similar to his work, after he had declined to sell them the rights to his song. He has been quoted as saying, \"Apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad — ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car.  I have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor.\" \n\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Tony Joe White": {
    "bio": "Tony Joe White (Oak Grove, Louisiana, July 23, 1943 - October 24, 2018) was an American swamp rock singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his 1969 hit \"Polk Salad Annie\" and for \"Rainy Night in Georgia\", which he wrote but was first made popular by Brook Benton in 1970. He also wrote \"Steamy Windows\" and \"Undercover Agent for the Blues\", both hits for Tina Turner in 1989; those two songs came by way of Turner's producer at the time, Mark Knopfler, who is a friend of White. \"Polk Salad Annie\" was also recorded by Elvis Presley and Tom Jones.\n\nTony Joe White was the youngest of seven children who grew up on a cotton farm near Oak Grove, Louisiana. He first began performing music at school dances, and after graduating from high school he performed in night clubs in Texas and Louisiana.\n\nIn 1967, White signed with Monument Records, which operated from a recording studio in the Nashville suburb of Hendersonville, Tennessee, and produced a variety of sounds, including rock and roll, country and western, and rhythm and blues. Billy Swan was his producer.\n\nOver the next three years, White released four singles with no commercial success in the U.S., although \"Soul Francisco\" was a hit in France. \"Polk Salad Annie\" had been released for nine months and written off as a failure by his record label, when it finally entered the U.S. charts in July 1969. It climbed to the Top Ten by early August, and eventually reached No. 8, becoming White's biggest hit.\n\nWhite's first album, 1969's Black and White, was recorded with Muscle Shoals/Nashville musicians David Briggs, Norbert Putnam, and Jerry Carrigan, and featured \"Willie and Laura Mae Jones\" and \"Polk Salad Annie\", along with a cover of Jimmy Webb's \"Wichita Lineman\". \"Willie and Laura Mae Jones\" was covered by Dusty Springfield on her album Dusty in Memphis also recorded in 1969.\n\nThree more singles quickly followed, all minor hits, and White toured with Steppenwolf, Anne Murray, Sly & the Family Stone, Creedence Clearwater Revival and other major rock acts of the 1970s, playing in France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and England.\n\nIn 1973, White appeared in the film Catch My Soul, a rock-opera adaption of Shakespeare's Othello. White played and sang four and composed seven songs for the musical.\n\nIn late September 1973, White was recruited by record producer Huey Meaux to sit in on the legendary Memphis sessions that became Jerry Lee Lewis's landmark Southern Roots album.[citation needed] By all accounts,[citation needed] these sessions were a three-day, around-the-clock party, which not only reunited the original MGs (Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and Al Jackson, Jr. of Booker T. and the MGs fame) for the first time in three years, but also featured Carl Perkins, Mark Lindsay (of Paul Revere & the Raiders), and Wayne Jackson plus The Memphis Horns.\n\n1980s\nFrom 1976 to 1983, White released three more albums, each on a different label. Trying to combine his own swamp-rock sound with the popular disco music at the time, the results were not met with success and White gave up his career as a singer and concentrated on writing songs.\n\n1990s comeback\nIn 1989, White produced one non-single track on Tina Turner's Foreign Affair album, the rest of the album was produced by Dan Hartman. Playing a variety of instruments on the album, he also wrote four songs,[2] including the title song and the hit single \"Steamy Windows\". As a result of this he became managed by Roger Davies, who was Turner's manager at the time, and he obtained a new contract with Polydor.\n\nThe resulting album, 1991's Closer to the Truth, was a commercial success[citation needed] and put White back in the spotlight. He released two more albums for Polydor; The Path of a Decent Groove and Lake Placid Blues which was co-produced by Roger Davies.\n\nIn the 1990s, White toured Germany and France with Joe Cocker and Eric Clapton, and in 1992 he played the Montreux Festival.\n\nIn 1996, Tina Turner released the song \"On Silent Wings\" written by White.\n\n2000s\nIn 2000, Hip-O Records released One Hot July in the U.S., giving White his first new major-label domestic release in 17 years. The critically acclaimed The Beginning appeared on Swamp Records in 2001, followed by Heroines, featuring several duets with female vocalists including Jessi Colter, Shelby Lynne, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, and Michelle White, on Sanctuary in 2004, and a live Austin City Limits concert, Live from Austin, TX, on New West Records in 2006. In 2004, White was the featured guest artist in an episode of the Legends Rock TV Show and Concert Series, produced by Megabien Entertainment.\n\nIn 2007, White released another live recording, Take Home the Swamp, as well as the compilation Introduction to Tony Joe White. Elkie Brooks recorded one of White's songs, \"Out of The Rain\", on her 2005 Electric Lady album. On July 14, 2006, in Magny-Cours, France, White performed as a warm-up act for Roger Waters' The Dark Side of the Moon concert. White's album, entitled Uncovered, was released in September 2006 and featured collaborations with Mark Knopfler, Michael McDonald, Eric Clapton, and J.J. Cale.\n\nThe song \"Elements and Things\" from the 1969 album ...Continued features prominently during the horse-racing scenes in the 2012 HBO television series \"Luck\".\n\nIn 2013, White signed to Yep Roc Records and released Hoodoo. Mother Jones called the album \"Steamy, Irresistible\"  and No Depression noted Tony Joe White is \"the real king of the swamp.\"  He also made his Live...with Jools Holland debut in London, playing songs from Hoodoo.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, White appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman alongside the Foo Fighters to perform \"Polk Salad Annie\". Pointing to White, Letterman told his TV audience, \"Holy cow! ... If I was this guy, you could all kiss my ass. And I mean that.\"\n\nIn May 2016, Tony Joe White released Rain Crow on Yep Roc Records.[8] The lead track \"Hoochie Woman\" was cowritten with his wife, Leann. The track \"Conjure Child\" is a follow up to an earlier song, \"Conjure Woman.\" \n\nThe album Bad Mouthin' was released in September 2018 again on Yep Roc Records. The album contains six self-penned songs and five blues standards written by, amongst others, Charley Patton and John Lee Hooker. On the album White also performs a cover of the Elvis Presley song Heartbreak Hotel. White plays acoustic and electric guitar on the album which was produced by his son Jody White and has a signature Tony Joe White laid back sound. \n\nIn 1969, deep voiced southern songsmith Tony Joe White had a U.S. Top 10 hit with his classic swamp rock tune \"Polk Salad Annie\". His bluesy songs have been covered by dozens of artists ranging from Elvis Presley and Tim McGraw, to Dusty Springfield and Tina Turner. His latest release in a forty plus year career is 2013's \"The Gift\".\n\nBorn in 1943, White was the youngest of seven children in a part-Cherokee family raised on a cotton farm, and first showed an interest in music at the age of 16 when he heard an album by Lightning Hopkins. He later began performing at school dances and night clubs, first as Tony and the Mojos and then as Tony and the Twilights.\n\nAfter moving to Memphis in the late 1960's, White was signed to Monument records and his first single release was a Ray Stevens song \"Georgia Pines\". \n\nWhite's 1969 debut album, Black And White, featured originals such as \"Willie And Laura Mae Jones\" and \"Polk Salad Annie,\" and psychedelic ode to the west coast \"Soul Francisco\" which became a hit in France. The album also featured a cover of Jimmy Webb's \"Wichita Lineman\". His follow up record for Monument was \"...Continued\" followed by Tony Joe in 1970, his last for Monument.\n\nBy 1970 he released The Train I'm On marking the fifth album in Tony Joe White's career, and his second recorded for Warner Bros. it was produced by Jerry Wexler and recorded at the legendary Muscle Shoals studio in Alabama. Johnny Cash had White as a guest on his tv show twice, and in Europe White gained legendary status following a successful debut at the historic Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. White's 2nd record on Warner Bros. in 1971 was a self titled disc recorded in Memphis with The Memphis Horns.\n\nIn late September 1973, White was recruited by producer Huey P. Meaux to sit in on the legendary Memphis sessions that became the landmark  Southern Roots album of Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nBy all accounts, these sessions were a three day, around the clock party, which not only reunited the original MGs (Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and Al Jackson Jr. of Booker T. and the MGs fame) for the first time in three years, they also featured rockabilly icon Carl Perkins, Mark Lindsay (of Paul Revere and the Raiders), and Wayne Jackson and The Memphis Horns.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s White toured in support of artists including Creedence Clearwater Revival and James Taylor. In the 1990s Tina Turner recorded four of his songs for her multi-platinum selling album Foreign Affairs, including the world-wide hit \"Steamy Windows\". With the advent of that project, White formed an alliance with Turner's manager, Roger Davies and his career began to soar.\n\nIn 1991 he signed with Remark, issued the Closer To The Truth album and spent the next two years touring Europe in support of Eric Clapton and Joe Cocker, among others. He cut two more albums for Remark, 1993's Path Of A Decent Groove and 1995's Lake Placid Blues, the latter garnering the first of two nominations for \"Best R & B Album\" from the Nashville Music Awards, (the second being, The Best Of Tony Joe White, a 1996 retrospective of his work on Warner Brothers). French audiences eagerly embraced White as the ‘Swamp Fox’ and in 1998, he became the subject of a French produced documentary: Tony Joe White-The Man From Down South.\n\nIn 1999, White went back to his roots and recorded One Hot July, in the swamps of Louisiana. He then toured Australia and Europe once again in support of the critically acclaimed album. In 2001, Audium and Koch Entertainment released The Beginning - a stripped-down acoustic album that received worldwide recognition and five star ratings in virtually every country.\n\nThroughout the years, White has had songs recorded by dozens of major artists including Elvis, Ray Charles, Joe Cocker, Etta James, Hank Williams Jr, John Mayall, and Waylon Jennings. Brook Benton had a huge hit with Rainy Night In Georgia, and Rory Gallagher did a cover of White's song \"As The Crow Flies\" on his live album Irish Tour. More recently, White has worked with Marc Bryan of Hootie & The Blowfish and Michael McDonald. He has written and performed jingles for McDonalds and Levi's 501 Blues and been featured on movie soundtracks for Millennium, Selena and Hotspot. His music has also been featured in two HBO original films, and has a DVD out entitled Live from Austin, TX. in 2006 Rhino records compiled all of White's late 60's Monument albums into a deluxe ltd edition 40 CD boxset called \"Tony Joe White - Swamp Music: The Complete Monument Recordings\"\n\nAnother recent CD release is Heroes and Heroines, on his own label, Swamp Records. White says he created the company with his son Jody White, so that he could continue to produce music his way.

  "U2": {
    "bio": "U2 are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1976. The group comprises Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, The Unforgettable Fire (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in a more abstract, ambient sound for the band. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Their fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. One of the world's best-selling albums with 25 million copies sold, it produced the group's only number-one singles in the US to date: \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary and double album Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991), and the multimedia spectacle of the Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative, industrial, and electronic dance music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on Zooropa (1993) and concluded after Pop (1997) and the PopMart Tour, which polarized audiences and critics. The group re-established a more conventional, mainstream sound on All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which were critical and commercial successes. Sales of subsequent albums declined, but the group remained a popular live act. The U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 held records for the most-attended and highest-grossing concert tour until 2019. Songs of Innocence (2014), the first of two companion albums in the 2010s, was criticised for its pervasive release through the iTunes Store. In 2023, U2 released Songs of Surrender, an album of re-recorded songs, and began the U2:UV Achtung Baby Live concert residency to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley.\n\nU2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. Their accolades include 22 Grammy Awards, eight Brit Awards, four Ivor Novello Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. They were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. According to Pollstar, they were the second-highest-grossing live music artist from 1980 to 2022, earning US$2.13 billion. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, DATA/the ONE Campaign, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2\n\nStudio albums\nBoy (1980)\nOctober (1981)\nWar (1983)\nThe Unforgettable Fire (1984)\nThe Joshua Tree (1987)\nRattle and Hum (1988)\nAchtung Baby (1991)\nZooropa (1993)\nPop (1997)\nAll That You Can't Leave Behind (2000)\nHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004)\nNo Line on the Horizon (2009)\nSongs of Innocence (2014)\nSongs of Experience (2017)\nSongs of Surrender (2023) User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Valerie June": {
    "bio": "Valerie June (born Valerie June Hockett in 1982) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist from Memphis, Tennessee. She began recording and performing in 2001, initially with her then-husband in the duo Bella Sun. In her solo work her sound encompasses a mixture of folk, blues, gospel, soul, country, Appalachian and bluegrass.\n\nIf June had been a roots artist in America 80 years ago, and she often sings as if she was, she might have been a principle influence on today's myriad retro troubadours, hers a stunningly emotive amalgamation of blues, folk, gospel, soul, Appalachian and bluegrass (including irresistible banjo). She exists, however, today, an artist as modern as an iPod Shuffle, a musician for the generation which carries the entire history of recorded music so casually inside its phone.\n\nLike a potent distillation bubbling on a Prohibition-era porch, Valerie June makes self-styled “organic moonshine roots music”, music for the porch parties of today, a party where she strums her guitar, plucks her banjo, opens her mouth and delta-blues-country stridently sashays out, a stunning peal somewhere between Dolly Parton and Billie Holiday. Or is it more Wanda Jackson and Shirley Goodman, you know, from Shirley & Co, who sang Shame Shame Shame so disco friskily in 1974? Valerie June does this to you: reaches inside your musical brain and shakes it, unleashing ghosts, emotions and memories, all fluttering like countless musical flakes inside the snowglobe of your mind.\n\nA self-taught musician, singer and song-writer from small-town Humboldt, Tennessee (population 8,000), she honed her astonishing sound in the vibrant Memphis atmosphere, her spectrum of influences the history of music itself: Elizabeth Cotten, Leadbelly, The Carter Family, Whitney Houston, Van Morrison, Dolly Parton, Roscoe Holcomb, Woody Guthrie, Nico, Junior Kimbrough, Nina Simone, Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Tracey Chapman, Billie Holiday, The Rolling Stones, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Mississippi John Hurt, Gillian Welch, Townes Van Zandt, Elmore James, Skip James, Blind Willie McTell, Memphis Minnie...\n\n\n“Being from Jackson and Humboldt, Tennessee, I was raised one hour from Memphis and two hours from Nashville,” lilts Valerie June, in her sing-song, southern belle way. “It was and still is hard to go anywhere without hearing\n\ncountry and blues music. It always reminds me of home. It's the place in art where the colour lines of the South seem to blend.”Her debut album, though, is that most rare of contemporary concepts: unique.\n\nPushin' Against A Stone, released on Rob da Bank's stellar boutique label Sunday Best, was mostly recorded at The Black Key's Easy Eye studio in Nashville. Produced by Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys) and Kevin Augunas (Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, Florence & The Machine) it's a sonic postcard from the universe, where the atoms of history live.\n\n\n“I just love old records,” she smiles, a beautiful woman with old-school dreadlocks spiraling out towards freedom. “I like the crackle, the gritty sound. So do a lotta other people! I think we just wanna hear real music. Alongside the modern beat-machine music. For a while it was only moving in a new direction and people started missing the old stuff. I think it's something people long for.”\n\n\nThe debut single, Workin’ Woman Blues, is a riot, a brand new bona-fide blues-pop anthem, as if Bobbie Gentry fronted a Stax soul-revue, those mesmerising vocals telling it how it is: “I ain't fit to be no mother, I ain't fit to be no wife, yeah, I been workin' like a man, y'all, I've been working all my life.” Elsewhere, there's the delicate yet rousing triumph of Somebody To Love (featuring the iconic Booker T. Jones), the traditional folk-gospel charm of Trials, Troubles, Tribulations, the spectral, swampy wooziness of Pushin' Against A Stone (The Specials meets Phil Spector) and the dizzy, harmonised, Shangri-La sashay of Wanna Be On Your Mind, Valerie June's voice sounding, somehow, both as old and wise as mother nature and as playfully naïve as a schoolgirl skipping home. Staggeringly, she'd never worked with a producer before, the experience opening her up to infinite new atmospheric possibilities.  \n\n“It was different,” she says. “  I'd been holding on to a particular image of what I wanted to be as a folk musician, a country musician, a southern roots musician. But when I heard the producers' ideas I thought, 'think bigger'. I looked at the careers of Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Joan Baez and they’ve put out all kinds of\n\nmusic over the course of their careers so far. If I wanna put out a punk rock record next week, that's me. It's all coming from me.  Even if I have to continue juggling jobs, I am a career artist.”\n\nWe don't hear so much, these days, from the old-school working class girls, the ones who can't afford the freedom to pursue their most daring dreams. Valerie June, the eldest girl of five kids (who'd often pretend to be the Jackson Five), first learned to sing in church, both a black church and later, a white church, when her family moved to the country. People sang in church, “even when they couldn't sing” and she'd mimic them all, “from homeless people to wealthy people until my own voice just started coming out, a mixture of everyone”. She had her first jobs as a teen, helping her dad, both a promoter for local gospel singers and in the construction business (she'd hang posters in town and then head to the demolition sites). Soon she was constantly singing, writing songs, a freedom-seeking spirit who went travelling as a wandering songbird up and down the American west coast, then the east coast, a gypsy nightingale and holistic craftswoman who'd sing for tips in subway stations and sell her own handmade soap. By the time she moved back to Memphis in 2000, she had a plethora of songs written and finally taught herself guitar and banjo, as neighbourhood eyes were raised. “Black people aren't supposed to play the banjo,” she laughs, “it's seen as country and bluegrass but it's an African instrument. I love it.” Soon, she was testing out her tentative musical skills in Memphis bars and restaurants, “which was more teaching myself in front of people,” she notes. “Memphis is a good town for being born as an artist. If you make a mistake people are like, 'we heard the good part'. They nurture you. You can take your time.”\n\n\nWith a dream to make a studio album and no cash to fund it, “it's hard to think about making a record when you've gotta pay rent”, she went to work full-time, now tunneling her way to freedom like Andy Dufresne in the Shawshank Redemption through daily, determined graft. She took on numerous service jobs: housekeeper, dog-walker, babysitter, vegetarian meal cooker, house sitter and personal assistant to the wealthy. And that was just the morning. “In the\n\nafternoon, I'd work in a herb shop, Maggie's Pharm. Then I would go play a gig, just me and my guitar.”\n\nShe began to musically emerge, playing the Memphis Music & Heritage Festival, the International Folk Alliance Conference, the Cooper-Young Festival, the King Biscuit Blues Festival in Helena, AR, finally making enough money for three lo-fi recordings which she sold as CDs on tour: the raw, acoustic The Way Of The Weeping Willow (recorded in an 1800s farmhouse), the vocally mesmerising Mountain Of Rose Quartz and the haunting Valerie June And The Tennessee Express, a collaboration with Nashville bluegrass troupe The Old Crow Medicine Show (who've toured with Mumford & Sons). “They're very successful at what they do, they loved my music and said 'hey, don't worry about money just come and record a few songs with us'.”\n\nIn 2009 she was a featured artist on MTV's online series $5 Cover (following the lives of Memphis musicians attempting to make ends meet) and eventually raised $15,000 through crowd-funding website Kickstarter to record a debut album proper. Then, the universe intervened: through word-of-mouth, the manager for producer Kevin Augunas heard Valerie's music, sent it to Augunas, who loved it so much he flew into Memphis the following day. He asked who she'd like to write with and she suggested Dan Auerbach, whose solo work she'd loved (and who had recently moved to Nashville). Valerie, deliberately, had never signed to a record label before, although there had been no shortage of offers from both major and independent US-based labels, and was spotted playing in France by Sunday Best's label partner Sarah Bolshi. “I never signed a label deal because it didn't feel right,” she says.  “I need to be with people who not only like this record but my stripped down stuff too. People will tell you, 'you can do whatever you wanna do with our label'. I didn't trust anybody telling me that until I met Sarah! And it's more me, a speciality label.”\n\n\nPushin' Against A Stone is so-called because that's the story of her life - and the story of her forebears, too.  “I feel I've spent my life pushing against a stone,” she says. “And the jobs I've had have been fitting for getting a true feel for how\n\nthe traditional artists I loved came home after a hard day to sit on the porch and play tunes until bedtime. That’s one reason why they were older before anybody cared. When I first started playing instruments I thought, OK, I'm probably not gonna be the next Beyonce, this is not gonna happen for me until I'm very very old. Like...Seasick Steve! Who I love. And then maybe somebody will come see me play in my shack in Mississippi. That's kinda how it is for many artists who make roots music. So I'm just really happy it's happening now and I'm not up there with my cane.”\n\n\nGood things come to those who wait and Valerie June's time is now, the last year bringing rave reviews at SXSW, a collaboration with Grammy-nominated Fugees producer John Forte (on the hip-hop-blues song Give Me Water) as the word-of-mouth whisper has gradually grown into a collective global holler. This September, one of her friends sent her a Facebook message saying she'd seen a video of her glorious Bestival Performance.  “And she said, 'you're gonna be a huge star',” smiles the captivating Valerie June. “A while ago I would've been like, I dunno about being a huge star. But now I'm like, you know what? If I can get a break? I will take it. I deserve it. I have paid my dues! I can't work on Maggie's Pharm no more. If you wanna bring me a coffee, yeah, I'll let you bring it. Because I have been the person bringing the coffee. I don't need any more experience in that. Now, being a queen? M'Kay! I think I can use a little spoiling. Bring it on.”\n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Van Morrison": {
    "bio": "Sir George Ivan \"Van\" Morrison, OBE (generally known as Van Morrison or Van The Man) (born 31 August 1945) is a Grammy Award-winning artist from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He's a singer, songwriter, author, poet, and multi-instrumentalist, who has been a professional musician since 1958. He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growl - a unique mix of folk, blues, Irish, scat, and Celtic influences - Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll. He has received numerous music awards during his career, including six Grammy Awards (1996–2007); inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (January 1993), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and the Irish Music Hall of Fame (September 1999); and a Brit Award (February 1994).\n\nKnown as \"Van the Man\" by his fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, writing their 1964 hit \"Gloria\". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career, starting with the album Astral Weeks.\n\nMorrison has pursued an idiosyncratic musical path. Much of his music is tightly structured around the conventions of American soul and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Moondance\", \"Domino\", and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as his classic album Astral Weeks and lesser known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic Soul,\" and Morrison rejects the characterization of his genre of music as Rock, citing Elvis Presley as a non-influence.\n\nHe continues to perform regularly and achieved his highest U.S. chart position (number ten on the Billboard 200) with his 2008 album, Keep It Simple.

  "Warren Zevon": {
    "bio": "Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 - September 7, 2003) was an American rock singer-songwriter and musician noted for including his unique and sometimes sardonic opinions of life in his musical lyrics, composing songs that were sometimes humorous and often had political or historical themes.\n\nZevon's work has often been praised by well-known musicians, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His best-known compositions include \"Werewolves of London\", \"Lawyers, Guns and Money\", \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner\" and \"Johnny Strikes Up The Band,\" all of which are featured on his third album, Excitable Boy (1978). Other well-known songs written by Zevon have been recorded by other artists, including \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), \"Accidentally Like a Martyr,\" \"Mohammed's Radio\", \"Carmelita\", and \"Hasten Down the Wind\".\n\nAlong with his own compositions, Zevon recorded or performed occasional covers, including Bob Dylan's \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" and Leonard Cohen's \"First We Take Manhattan\". He was a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman and the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman later performed guest vocals on \"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.\n\nHe was born to a Russian Jewish father and a Mormon mother and soon moved to California. At the age of 12/13, Warren Zevon was a regular visitor to the home of Igor Stravinsky where he, along with Robert Craft, would study music.\n\nHe turned to a musical career early, including a stretch as part of a Sonny and Cher-type male/female duo called Lyme and Cybelle, and spent time as a session musician (notably as piano player for the Everly Brothers) and jingle composer. He wrote several songs for his White Whale label-mates the Turtles, though his participation in their recording is unknown. Another early composition (\"She Quit Me\") was included in the soundtrack for Midnight Cowboy, released in 1969. His first attempt at a solo album, Wanted Dead or Alive (1969), did not fare well, and his second effort, Leaf in the Wind, was scrapped (though release was considered just prior to his death). In the early 70s he toured regularly with the Everly Brothers as keyboard player and band leader/musical coordinator. His dissatisfaction with his career and the opportunities for a song-writer led him to move to Spain briefly, where he played in a small bar owned by a former mercenary. Together, they penned Zevon's classic \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.\"\n\nIn the mid-70s he moved to Los Angeles, and became associated with the then-burgeoning West coast music scene, including collaborations with Jackson Browne, who would produce and promote Zevon's self-titled major-label debut in 1976, The Eagles, who appeared on that first album, and Linda Ronstadt, who would record several early Zevon songs including a hit version of \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\". Zevon's first tour in 1977 included guest appearances in the middle of Jackson Browne concerts.\n\nIn 1978 Zevon released his breakthrough album, Excitable Boy, to critical acclaim and popular success. Several tracks from this album received heavy FM airplay and the single release \"Werewolves of London\", which featured a relatively lighthearted version of Zevon's signature macabre outlook, was a top-ten hit.\n\nFor the next 20 years Zevon would continue to record and release albums sporadically and with varying levels of success, while fighting personal demons including an acknowledged battle with alcoholism and drugs. (His fourth album, Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School is dedicated to novelist Ross Macdonald, who crucially assisted Zevon during a particularly difficult episode in 1979.) Apparently success did not treat Zevon well, as evidenced by his movements (living on Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, etc.), well-documented stints in rehab, and withdrawal from the spotlight. After the release of The Envoy in 1982, Zevon effectively quit his career as a full-time occupation, appearing rarely and usually solo, without a band. He also collaborated with several members of R.E.M. to record as the Hindu Love Gods in 1990, though initial collaboration occurred during his \"lost period\" in 1984.\n\nIn 1987 Zevon made a comeback with a modest hit album Sentimental Hygiene, which featured collaborations with Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and members of R.E.M., among others including long-time collaborators Jorge Calderone and Waddy Wachtel. The follow-up album, Transverse City in 1989 also featured guests, including Jerry Garcia and David Gilmour. The tradition of collaborations with more famous musical talents was consistent throughout his career, from the appearance of Jackson Browne and The Eagles on his first album, to Bruce Springsteen on his last.\n\nZevon toured the US regularly during the 90s, often alone, with minimal accompaniment. He did conduct a tour with Odds, a band from Vancouver, Canada. Many tours started in Colorado to allow Warren an opportunity to visit with his long-time friend, Hunter S. Thompson. Warren was close to several prominent writers who also collaborated on song-writing, including Carl Hiassen. He also served as musical coordinator for an ad-hoc group called the Rock Bottom Remainders, a collection of writers performing rock and roll standards at book fairs and other events. This group included Stephen King, Dave Barry, and other popular writers.\n\nIn interviews, Zevon described a lifelong phobia of doctors and seldom received medical assessment. In 2002, after a long period of untreated illness and pain, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a doctor; when he did so he was diagnosed with inoperable mesothelioma (a form of lung cancer associated with exposure to asbestos rather than smoking). He then began recording his final album, The Wind, with guest appearances from close friends including Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty and others.\n\nOn October 30, 2002, Zevon was featured on the Late Show with David Letterman as the only guest for the entire hour. Zevon performed several songs and spoke at length about his illness. Zevon was a frequent guest and occasional substitute bandleader on Letterman's television shows since Late Night first aired in 1982. It was this show where Zevon offered his insight on facing death: \"enjoy every sandwich.\"\n\nZevon previously stated that his illness was expected to be terminal within months after the diagnosis in the Fall of 2002; however he lived to see the birth of twin grandsons in June of 2003 and the release of The Wind on August 28, 2003. When his diagnosis became public, he told the media that he just hoped to live long enough to see the next James Bond movie, a goal he also accomplished. Appropriately, the film was called Die Another Day.\n\nZevon died at his home in Los Angeles, California, on September 7, 2003. The Wind was certified gold by the RIAA in December of 2003 and Zevon received 5 posthumous Grammy nominations, including Song Of The Year for \"Keep Me In Your Heart\".\n\nA tribute album titled Enjoy Every Sandwich: Songs of Warren Zevon was released October 19, 2004. His son, Jordan Zevon, did a large part of the work on the album and performed \"Studebaker,\" a previously unreleased composition. A second tribute album, titled Hurry Home Early: the Songs of Warren Zevon (the lyrics \"hurry home early\" are from the song \"Boom Boom Mancini,\" on Sentimental Hygiene) was released by Wampus Multimedia on July 8, 2005.\n\nOn February 14, 2006, VH1 Classic premiered a video from a new compilation, \"Reconsider Me: The Love Songs of Warren Zevon.\" The video, titled \"She's Too Good For Me,\" aired every hour on the hour throughout the day. The video was not well received among many of Zevon's fans, as evidenced by their responses on the official Bulletin Board.

  "Wayland Jennings": {
    "bio": "Waylon Jennings was a singer, songwriter and guitarist, who recorded 60 albums and had 16 #1 country singles in a career that spanned five decades. Jennings lived a life straight out of a classic country song. With a baritone growl for a voice and a musical style that blended folk lyrics, rock rhythms, and honky-tonk-style instrumentation, Jennings's songs reflected the highs and lows of life on the road. In the 1950s he was mentored by pioneering rocker Buddy Holly, and he narrowly missed ending up a casualty of the same plane crash that killed Holly and two other young rockers in 1959, inspiring the expression \"The Day the Music Died.\" In the 1960s Jennings spent years trying to fit into the mainstream Nashville music scene before spearheading the outlaw music movement with Willie Nelson. Their efforts transformed country music in the 1970s, and years after his death Jennings’s vocal and musical style continued to influence new generations of country artists.\n\nWith pal Willie Nelson, Jennings performed duets like \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\", \"Luckenbach\" and \"Good Hearted Woman\". Those 1970s songs nurtured a progressive sound and restless spirit embraced later by Travis Tritt, Charlie Daniels, Steve Earle and others. His resonant, authoritative voice also was used to narrate the popular TV show The Dukes of Hazzard (1979). He sang its theme song, which was a million seller. \"I aimed the narration at children and it made it work,\" he said in a 1987 AP interview.\n\nHe traditionally wore a black cowboy hat and ebony attire that accented his black beard and mustache. Often reclusive when not on stage, he played earthy music with a spirited, hard edge. Combined, Jennings had a well-defined image that matched well with his history of battling record producers to do music his way. About his independence, he said: \"There's always one more way to do something-- your way.\" Some of his album titles nourished his brash persona: \"Lonesome, On'ry and Mean,\" \"I've Always Been Crazy,\" \"Nashville Rebel,\" \"Ladies Love Outlaws\" and \"Wanted: The Outlaws.\"\n\nHe often refused to attend music awards shows on grounds performers should not compete against each other. Despite those sentiments, Jennings won two Grammy awards and four Country Music Association awards. He did not attend his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nIn 1959, his career was nearly cut short by tragedy. He was scheduled to fly on the light plane that crashed and killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper. Jennings gave up his seat on the plane to The Big Bopper, who was ill and wanted to fly rather than travel by bus with those left behind. He and Holly were teenage friends in Lubbock, Texas, and Jennings was in Holly's band. \"Mainly what I learned from Buddy was an attitude,\" Jennings said. \"He loved music, and he taught me that it shouldn't have any barriers to it.\"\n\nBorn in Littlefield, Texas, Jennings became a radio disc jockey at 14 and formed his own band not long afterward. By the early 1960s Jennings was playing regularly at a nightclub in Phoenix. In 1963, he was signed by 'Herb Alpert''s A&M Records, then was signed by RCA in Nashville shortly thereafter by Chet Atkins. Once in Nashville, he and Cash became friends and roommates. His hit records began in the mid-1960s and his heyday was the mid-1970s.\n\nAbout his outlaw image, he said: \"It was a good marketing tool. In a way, I am that way. You start messing with my music, I get mean. As long was you are honest and up front with me, I will be the same with you. But I still do things my way.\" User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",

  "Willie Nelson": {
    "bio": "Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.\n\nBorn during the Great Depression and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky-tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote \"Family Bible\" and recorded the song \"Lumberjack\" in 1956. He also worked as a disc jockey at various radio stations in Vancouver and nearby Portland, Oregon. In 1958, he moved to Houston, Texas, after signing a contract with D Records. He sang at the Esquire Ballroom weekly and he worked as a disk jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"Funny How Time Slips Away\", \"Hello Walls\", \"Pretty Paper\", and \"Crazy\". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ...And Then I Wrote. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.\n\nIn 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album Red Headed Stranger. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, Wanted! The Outlaws, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like Honeysuckle Rose and recording hit songs like \"On the Road Again\", \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\", and \"Pancho and Lefty\", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson.\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed $32 million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film The Electric Horseman, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\nNelson uses a variety of music styles to create his own distinctive blend of country music, a hybrid of jazz, pop, blues, rock and folk. His \"unique sound\", which uses a \"relaxed, behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar\" and his \"nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing\", has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a \"vital icon in country music\", influencing the \"new country, new traditionalist, and alternative country movements of the 1980s and 1990s\".\n\nIn 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an amplifier and guitar with their \"Prismatone\" pickup. During a show in Helotes, Texas, Nelson left the guitar on the floor of the stage, and it was later stepped on by a drunk man. He sent it to be repaired in Nashville by Shot Jackson, who told Nelson that the damage was too great. Jackson offered him a Martin N-20 Classical guitar, and, at Nelson's request, moved the pickup to the Martin. Nelson purchased the guitar unseen for $750 and named it after Roy Rogers' horse \"Trigger\". The next year Nelson rescued the guitar from his burning ranch.\n\nConstant strumming with a guitar pick over the decades has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar's body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no pick-guard since classical guitars are meant to be played fingerstyle instead of with picks. Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches. The first signature on the guitar was Leon Russell's, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar. In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: \"When Trigger goes, I'll quit\". He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent arrived there, and then deliver it to him in Maui. Nelson then concealed the guitar in his manager's house until his debt was paid off in 1993.\n\nNelson is widely recognized as an American icon. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, and he received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998. In 2011, Nelson was inducted to the National Agricultural Hall of Fame, for his labor in Farm Aid and other fund raisers to benefit farmers. In 2015 Nelson won the Gershwin Prize, the lifetime award of the Library of Congress. In 2018 The Texas Institute of Letters inducted him among its members for his songwriting. He was included by Rolling Stone on its 100 Greatest Singers and 100 Greatest Guitarists lists.

    "bioSummary": "Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Willie+Nelson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

    "bio": "Wilson Pickett (March 18, 1941 – January 19, 2006) was an American R&B and soul singer. Known for his raw, passionate delivery, he played a major role in developing southern soul music. Aided immeasurably by the excellent studio bands backing him at the Stax Studios in Memphis, Tennessee and at the Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals Alabama, Pickett created iconic hits such as \"In the Midnight Hour,\" \"Mustang Sally,\" and \"Funky Broadway\" for Atlantic Records between 1963 and 1972.\n\nOne of the most popular black singers of the 60s, Wilson Pickett helped introduce the aggressive, rhythmic style of black music to a wide audience and has influenced almost countless rnb artists over the years. It all got started in Prattville, Alabama, where he was raised. Pickett moved to Detroit, Michigan at the age of sixteen, and he made his professional debut spending several years singing with the gospel group The Violinaires in the late 50s. From 1961 to 1963, he was in The Falcons, writing and singing their 1962 hit \"I Found A Love\".\n\nPickett then went solo and signed with Lloyd Price's Double L Records, where he wrote and recorded \"If You Love Me\" and \"It's Too Late.\" In 1964, Pickett signed with Atlantic Records and did his early recordings in the Stax studio in Memphis, Tennessee with Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper of The MGs. Cropper co-authored three of his early hits, \"In the Midnight Hour\" and \"Don't Fight It from his debut album The Exciting Wilson Pickett that established him as a major soul star. The album also included \"Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won't Do),\" \"She's So Good to Me,\" and \"Land of a 1,000 Dances,\" all recorded at Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals.\n\nPickett then had hits with \"Mustang Sally,\" \"I Found a Love,\" and \"Funky Broadway,\" all recorded in Muscle Shoals. Pickett then teamed with Bobby Womack in 1968 for Midnight Mover that yielded a Top 10 R7B and pop hit with Womack's title song. In 1969, Pickett had a major hit with The Beatles \"Hey Jude,\", followed in 1970 by \"Sugar, Sugar.\" Later in 1970, Pickett worked with producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. The result was two crossover hits \"Engine Number Nine,\" and \"Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You.\"\n\nAfter crossover hits \"Don't Knock My Love - Part 1\" and \"Fire and Water\" Pickett left Atlantic for RCA, with minimum success. Pickett later recorded for several record companies, including his own Wicked label, but failed to have anymore hits.\n\nWilson Pickett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.In 1999 he performed with his friend Bruce Springsteen.In 2002 he performed in the movie Only The Strong Survive.Singing his classic hits like In the Midnight hour and Land Of 1000 Dances.In 2004 Pickett retired from performing do to Health problems.Pickett told his sister he was going to the field of God but he never recovered.\n\nOn January 19,2006 Pickett died of a heart attack at his home.

    "bio": "There is more than one artist with this name, including: \n1) Yarn is an American alt-country band from Brooklyn, NYC; \n2) Yarn was a Ukrainian avant-folk band from Kyiv;  \n3) Yarn is an American downtempo/psychill artist from Los Angeles; \n4) Yarn is an American rock band from Highland, Illinois; \n5) Yarn is the duo Ferenc Majercsik and Nandor Horvath; \n6) YARN is New Zealand DnB producer Keaun Owen from Dunedin; \n7) Yarn was a Belgian indie-pop duo active during the 2010s; \n8) Yarn is a German psych-punk trio from Düsseldorf. \n\n1) Yarn is an American alt-country band from Brooklyn, NYC. Brooklyn might seem an odd place of origin for a country band.  The perennial home of cold concrete, hipsters and industrial ruins has been most famous for its indie rock scene over the past decade.  But to Blake Christiana, frontman and songwriter for Brooklyn-based Americana/Alt-Country band Yarn, it’s the place that offered not only solace from his Schenectady, NY upbringing and a place to meet other skilled musicians, but a certain anonymity perfect for a songwriter who crafts best in loneliness.\nIndeed, in the song “Time Burns On” off the band’s new record Come On In, Blake croons for the city in his best country twang, “I gotta get back / To my Brooklyn flat / Where the neighbors don’t know my name / And the forecast calls for rain.”\nYarn received quite a bit of buzz in the Americana world as a result of the band’s first two recordings as well as strong performances at clubs and festivals. Their self-titled debut record reached No. 14 on the AMA and R&R Radio Charts, and ranked No. 79 on the AMA’s Top 100 Albums of 2007. Yarn’s 2008 follow-up, Empty Pockets, which features guest appearances by Edie Brickell, Tony Trischka, Casey Dreissen and Caitlin Cary of Whiskeytown, spent months in the AMA charts.  The album peaked at No. 5 and was honored with eight first round 2009 Grammy nominations in several categories.\nThe band owes as much to Gram Parsons and Earl Scruggs as to Jerry Garcia and Exile On Main Street-era Rolling Stones.  Following in a fine tradition that includes forward thinking roots bands like The Flying Burrito Brothers and New Riders of The Purple Sage, Yarn weaves roots music idioms into a fresh sound that turns on hipsters and fans of country music alike with technically impressive song-crafting and universal tales from the road of life.\n\n2) Yarn was an avant-folk band from Kyiv, Ukraine, that consisted of Іван Москаленко [aka DJ Derbastler] (bass, drum machine, electric bass), Ольга \"Птіца\" Гориніна (lead vocals), Олександр Юрченко [Alexander Yurchenko] (cymbals, electric bass), Леонід Белей [Leonid Beley] (accordion, flute).\n\n3) Yarn is a downtempo/psychill artist from LA. \n\n4) A rock band from Highland, Illinois. \n\n5) Yarn is the duo Ferenc Majercsik and Nandor Horvath. \n\n6) YARN is New Zealand DnB producer Keaun Owen from Dunedin. \n\n7) Yarn was a Belgian indie-pop duo active during the 2010s. \n\n8) Yarn is a German psych-punk trio from Düsseldorf.

  "Ziggy Marley": {
    "bio": "David Nesta \"Ziggy\" Marley (born October 17, 1968 in Saint Ann Parish, ghetto of Trenchtown, Jamaica), composer, singer and guitarist, is a multiple Grammy-winning (reggae) Jamaican musician. He is known for songs like \"Tomorrow People\", \"Love Is My Religion\" and \"A Lifetime\", He is the oldest son in the marriage between the singer Rita Anderson (Marley) and late legendary reggae Bob Marley. David's father Bob nicknamed him \"Ziggy\". A ziggy is a big marijuana spliff  on Jamaiaca.\n\nZiggy learned  Rastafari faith from his parents and had access to some of the world's best reggae musicians in the comp band of his father – the legendary reggae Wailers. Ziggy Marley first sat in on recording sessions with Bob Marley and the Wailers when he was around 10 years old. Joining with his three siblings to become The Melody Makers, Ziggy crafted his own soulful sound blending blues, RnB, hip-hop and roots reggae.\n\nAfter their first two albums, Play The Game Right (1985) and Hey World! (1986), The Melody Makers earned their first Grammy (Best Reggae Recording) for Conscious Party (1988), an album produced by Talking Heads Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth which included the hit songs \"Tomorrow People\" and \"Tumbling Down.\"\n\nSubsequent albums included the Grammy-winning One Bright Day (1989), Jamekya (1991), Joy and Blues (1993), Free Like We Want 2 B (1995), their third Grammy winner Fallen is Babylon (1997), Spirit of Music (1999) and Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers Live, Vol 1 (2000), which featured some of their biggest hits as well as a cover of Bob Marley's \"Could You Be Loved.\"\n\nWhile selling records by the millions and selling out countless concerts with the Melody Makers, including a recent European tour, Ziggy Marley has never lost sight of his foundation of faith, fellowship and family.\n\nAfter two decades as the driving creative force behind The Melody Makers, Ziggy stepped out on his own with his first solo album, Dragonfly (2003). Never content to rehash the success of his past, Ziggy uses Dragonfly to explore new ground and create his own distinctive musical identity as a solo artist.\n\n\"Working on my own gave me a chance to take my time and experiment a lot,\" Ziggy says of the material on Dragonfly.\" It took one year to finish this record. It's the longest I've ever worked on a album. It's different when you on your own. At some point it's scary and then at another it's a drive that makes you focus more.\"\n\nAlthough the members of the most close-knit musical families often yearn to step out on their own, for Ziggy, a solo debut was not a long-awaited goal. \"It's not something that I wished for since I began doing music,\" he says. \"It was just the circumstances, and I wanted to be true to myself and what I feel. The record has strong messages and it feels good.\"\n\nIn addition to being Ziggy's first album of solo material, for Dragonfly he felt it was time for a change of scene. \"Usually we record in Kingston. These songs were written in Jamaica and recorded in America. I did the first set of recordings in a house in Miami and then went to L.A. rented a house, set up my equipment and basically did the rest there. I left Jamaica for a while, because as an artist I need to experience different things, to see the world and have different energies. Living in one place is not good for me and I was tired of making music in a studio setting. I wanted it to be more like everyday life a part of me.\n\n\"As an individual, I've opened up more by traveling outside Jamaica, and I've been more able to be open to people and ideas. It helps me to grow as a person to be outside of my element; to be on my own in a strange place meeting people. That's good for me not to be in my secure domain.\"\n\nThe evidence of that growth is everywhere on Dragonfly.\n\nOn July 2nd, 2006, Ziggy released his second album, Love is My Religion. He states \"This album is from my heart,\" and he feels that he embraces his spiritual and emotional side of life. This album show Ziggy coming into his own as an artist, as he wrote all of the songs for the album and played nearly all of the instruments.\n\nLove is My Religion is a testament to Ziggy Marley's talent as he follows in the footsteps of his father, the Legend. \n User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.",
