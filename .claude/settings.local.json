Now using sequential processing with 150ms delays between track\nmatches, reducing request rate to ~6.7 req/sec \\(well below Spotify''s limits\\).\n\nChanges:\n- Replace Promise.all\\(\\) with sequential for-loops in both createPlaylist functions\n- Add 150ms delay between track matches \\(applies to both API searches and indexed lookups\\)\n- Increase batch request delay from 300ms to 1000ms as additional safeguard\n- Remove redundant delay logic from matchTracks utility \\(now handled at composable level\\)\n\nThis approach ensures the application respects Spotify''s rate limits for both\nmega-playlists and individual playlist imports.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]\\(https://claude.com/claude-code\\)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Haiku 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
