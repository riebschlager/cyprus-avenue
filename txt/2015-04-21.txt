The iconic Robuck “Pops” Staples was responsible for some of the most essential music of the last 50 years.  He and his family carved out distinct spaces in both the gospel and R&B genres, while creating a soundtrack for the Civil Rights Movement with songs like “I’ll Take You There,” and “Respect Yourself.”  Just days short of his 86th birthday, as he laid on his dying bed, Pops handed daughter Mavis Staples a recording of some of his final tracks, with the instruction, “Mavis, don’t lose this here.” Ten years later “this here” has been released, and it’s the subject of this edition of Cyprus Avenue.
