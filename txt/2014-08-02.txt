New York City's Brill Building was known as a "one stop shop" that produced some great music in the '50s and '60s.  Last February, Cyprus Avenue host Bill Shapiro focused on music written by two of the great writing teams from the building.  This time around, he focuses more on the great music that originated from the hit factory that the Brill Building became.
