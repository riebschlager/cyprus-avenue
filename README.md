# Cyprus Avenue Playlist Archive

A comprehensive archive of playlists from KCUR's legendary **Cyprus Avenue** radio show, hosted by Bill Shapiro for over 40 years (1978-2018). Includes a modern web application for browsing playlists, artists, and tracks with integrated Spotify playback.

## About Cyprus Avenue

Cyprus Avenue was a Saturday night institution on KCUR 89.3 FM in Kansas City, featuring "the world of popular music from gospel to rock - from country to reggae - from a different point of view." Bill Shapiro, a Kansas City tax attorney by day and music enthusiast by night, curated unique playlists introducing listeners to both classic and contemporary artists across all genres. He passed away in January 2020 at age 82.

## Data Format

All playlists are available in structured JSON format:

### Individual Playlists
Each episode has its own JSON file in [`json/individual/`](json/individual/):
```json
{
  "date": "2015-01-03",
  "title": "2014 Favorites",
  "description": "As we look forward to what 2015 will bring...",
  "tracks": [
    {
      "artist": "Rosanne Cash",
      "song": "A Feather's Not A Bird"
    }
  ],
  "source_url": "https://www.kcur.org/tags/cyprus-avenue",
  "archived_date": "2025-12-31"
}
```

### Consolidated Data
All playlists are also available in a single file: [`json/playlists.json`](json/playlists.json)

## Using the Data

### Quick Start - Python
```python
import json

# Load all playlists
with open('json/playlists.json', 'r') as f:
    playlists = json.load(f)

# Find all Bob Dylan songs
dylan_songs = []
for playlist in playlists:
    for track in playlist['tracks']:
        if 'Dylan' in track['artist']:
            dylan_songs.append(track)

print(f"Found {len(dylan_songs)} Dylan tracks")
```

### Quick Start - JavaScript
```javascript
const playlists = require('./json/playlists.json');

// Get all unique artists
const artists = new Set();
playlists.forEach(playlist => {
  playlist.tracks.forEach(track => {
    artists.add(track.artist);
  });
});

console.log(`${artists.size} unique artists`);
```

## Example Queries

- **Search by artist**: Find all tracks by a specific artist
- **Search by date**: Get playlists from a specific time period
- **Genre analysis**: Identify most-played artists or songs
- **Playlist recreation**: Use the data to create Spotify/Apple Music playlists

## Workflow - Maintaining the Archive

**New to the project?** See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for detailed instructions.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Update playlists after editing txt files (fast - ~1 second)
./update-playlists.sh

# Discover new playlists on KCUR (slow - ~30 seconds)
./discover.sh

# Index tracks with Spotify (very slow - ~7-10 minutes)
./index-spotify.sh

# Fetch artist bios from Last.fm (~5 minutes)
node scripts/lastfm/fetch-artist-bios.js

# Enrich artist images from Spotify (~2 minutes)
node scripts/spotify/enrich-artist-images.js

# Consolidate tags from all sources (~1 minute)
node scripts/consolidate-genres.js
```

### Common Tasks

**Fix errors in a playlist:**
1. Edit the `.txt` file in `archive/txt/`
2. Run `./update-playlists.sh`
3. Check validation report

**Add a new playlist:**
1. Create a new `.txt` file in `archive/txt/` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD.txt`)
2. Run `./update-playlists.sh`
3. Optionally run `./index-spotify.sh` for Spotify links

See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for complete documentation.

## Tools & Scripts

### Data Pipeline Scripts

#### Parser (`scripts/parsing/parse_playlists.py`)
Converts raw text files to structured JSON. Handles multiple playlist formats and extracts artist/song information.

```bash
./update-playlists.sh
```

#### Discovery Tool (`scripts/discovery/discover_playlists.py`)
Scrapes KCUR website to find available playlists and identify gaps in the archive.

```bash
./discover.sh
```

### API Integration Scripts

All API scripts require credentials in a `.env` file. See [scripts/spotify/README.md](scripts/spotify/README.md) for setup.

#### Spotify Track Indexer (`scripts/spotify/index-spotify-tracks.js`)
Indexes all tracks with Spotify API to provide direct track links in the web app.

```bash
./index-spotify.sh
# or: node scripts/spotify/index-spotify-tracks.js
```

#### Spotify Track Recovery (`scripts/spotify/recover-missing-tracks.js`)
Interactive tool to manually match tracks that weren't found automatically.

```bash
node scripts/spotify/recover-missing-tracks.js
```

#### Last.fm Artist Bios (`scripts/lastfm/fetch-artist-bios.js`)
Fetches artist biographies, tags, and statistics from Last.fm API.

```bash
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_key node scripts/lastfm/fetch-artist-bios.js
```

#### Spotify Artist Images (`scripts/spotify/enrich-artist-images.js`)
Enriches artist data with high-quality images from Spotify (since Last.fm no longer provides images).

```bash
node scripts/spotify/enrich-artist-images.js
```

#### Tag Consolidation (`scripts/consolidate-genres.js`)
Merges tags from multiple sources (Last.fm tags, Spotify artist genres, track genres) into a unified tag system.

```bash
node scripts/consolidate-genres.js
```

## Historical Significance

2. **Cultural Heritage**: Documents nearly 8 years of Kansas City's music culture through Bill Shapiro's unique perspective
3. **Musical Diversity**: Showcases an eclectic mix of genres from a legendary radio host
4. **Structured Data**: Makes 40+ years of musical curation searchable and analyzable
